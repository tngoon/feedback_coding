avoid elongated introductory credits or similar since youre well over time,11,1,1,0,
being a little generous here like i said needs more work,11,0,0,0,
close enough needs a little more polish but no major issues,11,0,0,0,
first link doesnt work but i can understand what youre testing,11,1,0,0,
good thinking to make use of a timely event going on,11,0,0,0,

this has very little functionality and isnt really a paper prototype,11,0,0,0,
very cute polished app and funny video good work this quarter,11,0,0,0,
what happens if the user completed some of the logged items,11,1,0,0,
be careful about some of your styling some text is cut off,12,1,0,0,
couldnt test this as both urls took me to the same version,12,0,1,0,
do you mean to say you have 150 users test the app,12,0,0,0,
explanation could be more explicit about the connection between observations and brief,12,1,0,0,
good insight but the paragraph should have connected more with nielsens heuristics,12,1,0,0,
i do like how your interface is unique continue the good work,12,1,0,0,
i dont really see a script the steps are nicely detailed though,12,1,0,0,
its not a good idea to put boilerplate text in a prototype,12,1,0,0,
make sure it fits a mobile layout and have a logout button,12,1,1,0,
nice to hear a voiceover it is very useful to summarize interactions,12,1,0,0,
pay a little more attention to the navigational flow of the app,12,0,1,0,
the deduction came due to the lack of interaction with users personality,12,1,0,0,
the first two storyboards would be difficult to develop a prototype from,12,1,0,0,
the gamerewards component should be a bit more clear from the homepage,12,1,1,0,
the leap from using the app to playing a game is unclear,12,1,0,0,
the observations were more focused on the actions than the users themselves,12,1,0,0,
the photo captions do not include explanation about where how breakdowns occurred,12,1,0,0,
there is no comparison the two columns do not really do that,12,1,0,0,
this sounds more like a description of the app than the inspiration,12,1,0,0,
tie it more to the brief but youre on the right track,12,0,0,0,
try reducing the focus on interface elementsdetails phrasing it more naturally instead,12,1,1,0,
try to think of your point of view in a broader fashion,12,0,0,0,
what is the difference between the drawing page and the dream games,12,1,0,0,
you might further want to conduct comparative analysis on existing banking apps,12,1,1,0,

cant see your github to determine if this rubric point has been satisfied,13,1,0,0,
correct analysis for the clicks but again the time data was not analyzed,13,1,1,0,
good work on the drawing functionality creative idea good work all quarter long,13,1,0,0,
how does the user input where they need to go from this page,13,1,0,0,
i really like the idea in the second to last panel in 3,13,0,0,0,
interface could use more visual design components but its simple enough to understand,13,1,1,0,
is the target audience only those who are interested in bodybuilding specifically male,13,1,0,0,
it seems a bit artificial to ask a user to assume a persona,13,1,0,0,
its unclear from the video what exactly the purpose of the app is,13,1,0,0,
just needs minor tweaking in terms of design such as being mobile responsive,13,1,1,0,
minor change would be to add an other category for the expenses categories,13,1,1,0,
next time make your dev plan bigger can barely tell its been updated,13,1,1,0,
not entirely sure where the motivation or gamelike components come into play still,13,1,0,0,
or maybe we can rethink the problem from the recruiters side of view,13,0,1,0,
overall good job im looking forward to seeing the piggy bank in action,13,0,0,0,
seems like both left and right feeds have a specific color palette used,13,1,0,0,
some of them you put oops i do not know what that means,13,0,0,0,
symbols and navigation are might be a bit confusing for a new user,13,1,0,0,
the choice of colors beigesimilar and light green probably has just enough contrast,13,1,0,0,
the next week could be busy but looking forward to seeing the improvement,13,0,0,0,
the storyboards arent really focused on tasks more so just the planning component,13,1,0,0,
the student aspect is too simplified you need to take a firmer stance,13,1,1,0,
the surveys are kind of overwhelming all on one page consider redistributing them,13,1,1,0,
too broad and not a comment about people but more about personal informatics,13,1,0,0,
try to make this more comprehensive to have fewer iterations in the future,13,0,1,0,
very cluttered it would be hard to make a functional app from this,13,1,0,0,
what do i do on the missions how do i finish a mission,13,1,0,0,
would be nice if user could add a task directly from the homepage,13,1,1,0,
you may need to start wizard of ozzing some of the game development,13,0,0,0,
you mean not having an immediate way to go to the home screen,13,1,0,0,
1 point of extra credit awarded for drawing functionality and visual design good work,14,0,0,0,
also there is no mention of time taken estimated and actual on the plan,14,1,1,0,
dont worry about anymore login functionality ignore what future rubrics might say no login,14,1,1,0,
editing adding or deleting a goal is not working adding amount is not working,14,1,0,0,

i dont have permission to view your wireframes even after creating a balsamiq account,14,1,0,0,
i love the analogy here but the need and satisfaction are a bit unclear,14,1,1,0,
its ready but only because you dont have very much interaction to your app,14,0,0,0,
next time add user in front of needs so statement reads as user needs,14,1,1,0,
not sure where your data are coming from but i see the each loops,14,0,0,0,

there are some interesting changes but they should be reasoned referencing the corresponding violations,14,1,0,0,
there are some interesting changes such as 3 but they should be well reasoned,14,1,0,0,
there is no actual submit button for memories but there is one for bucketlist,14,1,0,0,
there is scope to make it better given how relatively rich your observations are,14,1,0,0,
this submission looks identical to dannys for the feedback please check out dannys submission,14,1,0,0,
use of maroondark red on a black background offers little contrast to ease readability,14,1,1,0,
user needs should be address a general audience so instead of jackjeremycaroline use student,14,1,0,0,
youve only included a breakdown in caption 3 there need to be more present,14,1,1,0,
as i said before please provide a url instead of a hyperlink in future submissions,15,1,1,0,
finally a somewhat original idea even though it might fall under taboo ill allow it,15,1,0,0,
good job on breaking down what constitutes pleasant tripplanning into this list of user needs,15,1,0,0,
good start make the data and your questions more interesting not just gym and hw,15,1,1,0,
great job please revisit the feedback you received during the studio section and continue rocking,15,1,0,0,
i would suggest that the layout be adjusted to reduce the amount of scrolling required,15,1,1,0,
im not sure how in terms of code youre measuring this but it seems reasonable,15,0,0,0,

the feature is not completed does not publish location and can not view said location,15,1,0,0,
the point of view doesnt identify concrete issues and could simply be a good observation,15,1,0,0,
there are some interesting changes but they should be reasoned referencing the heuristics being violated,15,1,1,0,

might be easier to group your tasks by assignment so that it matches the grading rubric better,17,1,1,0,
missing alot of content per se can be made into something more creative than a simple roulette,17,1,0,0,
missing opinion on heuristic evaluation also the tone should be less confrontational its not an opposing group,17,1,1,0,

it is a little too suggestive of how things should be without identifying why people go wrong now,18,1,0,0,
items in the garden dont persist so its difficult to see how the items are impacting the garden,18,1,0,1,

this storyboard has a little too much focus on the specific features of the app and the interface,18,1,0,0,

i dont see any comparative feedback i believe you may have mixed up the reflection paragraph and comparative feedback,19,1,0,0,
i dont see enough detail you havent explored all the options that your app provides on the home screen,19,1,0,0,
i think it can be confusing for firsttime users when they first enter the front page of the app,19,1,0,0,
i wish the tasks were in some sort of order so in alphabetical or chronological by due date order,19,1,1,0,
i wish there was a voice over explaining step by step what you were doing while using the app,19,1,1,0,
it would be better if you also included the evaluation in response to which you suggested each proposed change,19,1,1,0,

after deleting uncle bob theres no way to verify that it actually got deleted check out the video below httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjyqgg9kxlu,20,1,1,0,

i would keep it more precise such as using only your last statement and changing the wording of that slightly,20,1,1,0,
its interesting to read how common interaction appears from different people trip planning really changes over time with the apps,20,1,0,0,
looks good but can be cleaned up such as the layout of pictures i would like a separator between pictures,20,1,1,0,
removing a blocked website from the block page and the task page does not lower the count of blocked websites,20,1,0,0,
some of the needs are quite interesting so maybe you could dig deeper to split them into more finegrained ones,20,0,1,0,
speed test didnt work id suggest making use of an alternative framework its been giving you problems for a while,20,1,0,0,
the point of view should identify the essence of the problem without thinking too much about how to address it,20,1,0,0,
the pov does mention the core problem of taking notes however it offers a solution ucsd notes making it invalid,20,1,0,0,
there are placeholders for features introduce function 1 etc but not the actual description of what each feature might do,20,1,0,0,
these storyboards assume that taskcompletion is inherently competitive but is it really why would giving someone points motivate someone more,20,1,0,1,
would have been nice to see more of the navigational interactions in the app but the main features were covered,20,1,0,0,
you could make it work for any usernamepassword as there is no notion of different user profiles or a signup,20,1,0,0,
you dont need to provide a solution to each user need you just need to write about the need problem,20,1,1,0,
as the design process continues try to stray away from creating an application that replicates yelp adding reviews tips and ratings,21,1,0,0,
breakdownssuccesses identified but uninspired due to the subject of observation you just watched your roommates which i advised against in studio,21,1,0,0,
each listed change should be justified by explaining which piece of feedback you received caused you to propose this particular change,21,1,1,0,
i had to look at your html code to figure out how to get past the login screen it isnt fake,21,1,0,0,
i think the idea of visualizing the cognitive effort and decisions made to save the most out of spending is novel,21,1,0,0,
i would have rather seen a wireframe of the core functionality like the data my statistics case studies and observations pages,21,1,1,0,
interesting idea for an activity but do people usually count the number of pictures they took on instagram by any means,21,1,0,0,

pages are not completely connected there isnt a consistent way to go back to the first page from the second page,21,1,0,0,
see how the layout will appear on mobile it seems like a zoomed out tablet layout due to some sparse areas,21,1,0,0,
the connection to citizen science is tenuous it seems more like youre developing a product for a company than doing science,21,1,0,0,
the deduction was given because i saw more than a good amount of similarities between the first and the third prototypes,21,1,0,0,
theres actually no reason to have multiple data files everything can be contained within one large data structure your call though,21,1,1,0,
think of a more descriptive title than home you seem to have not followed the wireframes too closely good job otherwise,21,1,1,0,
think of what else can be done in terms of fulfilling needs that a simple note taking app will fail at,21,1,1,0,
this is an interesting take on learning recipes its unclear how the levels progress or what happens as levels progress though,21,0,0,0,
try to be more clear who the target user is with a more general example or by mentioning in the voiceover,21,1,1,0,
would be nice to be able to view the last message exchanged in the chat view along with the user name,21,1,1,0,
you activity seems to be examining games more than examining a behavior which is more the point of the studio brief,21,1,1,0,
you have all these unnecessary columns that make it hard to read fix or i will take off points next time,21,1,1,0,
your use of buttons as suggested search terms is not very effective in conveying what the user is supposed to do,21,1,0,0,
youve mentioned a solution your pov should not include a solution all you need to do is remove the second sentence,21,1,1,0,
a home button on the home screen appears redundant also the welcome message could be used as a link to the profile,22,1,1,0,
almost taboo ill allow it if its really from the direction of tracking procrastination and things around that rather than productivity directly,22,1,0,0,
change password manage friends and help support links not made they should have placeholder pages like the other links in your app,22,1,1,0,
explanations should be a bit more thorough though for example maybe include some of how your interactions were hindered by these violations,22,1,1,0,
i agree itll be more consistent to have the to the right arrow button positioned on the righthand side of the image,22,1,1,0,
i cant save a workout any more it worked in the lab hence you still receive the point but only this week,22,1,0,0,
i dont see any flexibility for the user to think about how to do any task since precise instructions are being given,22,0,0,1,
i think it would be useful to explain or describe that the dreams are recorded in the eggs its not completely obvious,22,1,1,0,
it appears that both the original and redesigned app link to the same url i asked on piazza for the teams url,22,1,0,0,
it would be better if the cancel button the one that appears when the add friends button was clicked was more visible,22,1,1,0,
it would be good if the task description was a little more detailed including the components it will develop and acceptance criteria,22,1,1,0,
make sure to make a more detailed login page if youre going to have one especially with pictures that dont have watermarks,22,1,1,0,

try to have more specific and actionable tasks also plan a week in advance so a5 should have tasks distributed across members,22,1,1,0,
typing an incorrect username will pass the login page but will give a 404 error please check out the video below httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv81m5ti1hus,22,1,1,0,
unclear whether these tasks were completed as there isnt anything input with regards to whether the task is in progress or complete,22,1,0,0,
user needs should apply to a broad audience so instead of the subjects name use user student etc for example user needs,22,1,1,0,

you cant come to a conclusion if one change made things better or worse if you have more than that single change,22,1,0,0,
you could prepare a great demo with the crowded report graphs maybe try to make that page a bit less cluttered though,22,1,1,0,

hard to achieve the task due to navigational error and the resolution misfit please fix both of them before proceeding to further implementation,23,1,1,1,
i couldnt find a way to go back to the main page at first i think the home button should be more accessible,23,1,1,0,
if some of the controls and bugs are fixed its almost complete to be tested without a problem looking forward to test results,23,0,1,0,
if someone uses a different service say pinterest for example then maybe we can also look into a different aspect of selforganized memories,23,1,1,0,
interesting observations of individuals who are seemingly doing diverse activities but great effort in trying to aggregate those activities distill some common insights,23,1,1,0,
is it possible to see all of the progresses in an aggregate manner rather than having to go into each of the items,23,1,0,0,
make sure to isolate a single difference between the two versions otherwise itll be hard to reason about different users behavior if any,23,1,1,1,
mission gameplay doesnt show any puzzle or instructions for what to do during the mission it also seems the socketio instance isnt running,23,1,1,0,
most of these needs have to do with improving games rather than improving human behavior which is the point of the studio brief,23,1,0,1,
note to other instructors this team uses an aws hosted db and not a json giving them points since this is the case,23,1,0,0,
see that existing workout data is more complete ex chest shows distance to be na which doesnt help a new user at all,23,1,0,1,
the one thing thats unclear with the app is how the points are calculated and what the user can do with the points,23,1,0,0,
the screen is not responsive when put in developer mode the app becomes super small remember that this should be optimized for mobile,23,1,1,0,
the updated development plan makes it seem like most of the assignment tasks were not complete because no information about progress was added,23,1,0,1,
this prototype doesnt achieve the goal of centralizing information rather its creating a platform for a fragment of information commentsreviews of a courses,23,1,0,1,
would be good to include how these users might use myfitnesspal on mobile when theyre eating a meal outside the house as well,23,1,1,0,
also pay close attention to the situation when users have to make changes to already existing milestones how could you streamline those update requests,24,1,0,0,
editing a workout is buggy the title can be changed only if blank just going back doesnt discard changes when you add an exercise,24,1,1,0,
feedback did not provide enough comparisons between the two prototypes that highlight the similarities and differences and the advantages and disadvantages of each design,24,1,1,0,
gave point because 2 of 3 photos depict the need at hand the first photo does not really capture the need you are describing,24,1,1,0,
good consider using wireframes for the rest of your development post on piazza for feedback so that you optimize the time you spend coding,24,1,1,1,
i could not reward you a point because the screens for invite housemates help center settings and log out are missing aka dead links,24,1,1,1,
i didnt get to see much of the interface of the prototype so im unsure of how the user exactly interacts with the prototype,24,1,0,0,

ps make sure to fix the positioning of elements such as ingredients on the create recipe page as they appear to be cut out,24,1,1,0,
they all kind of center around the idea of waiting in line which is fine but that isnt a core part of your pov,24,1,0,0,
who is doing which task need to know this so i can see if there is a fair breakdown of work within your team,24,1,1,1,
you all have made such good progress since the beginning of the quarter great work your video seemed to be a hit in class,24,1,0,1,
additionally how may your application differ from oneclasswhere users are paid to submit their notesor courseherowhere users can get access to tests homeworks midterms etc,25,1,1,0,
because it seems like its missing important interactions what does the magnifying glass and plus buttons do a functional application would be difficult to implement,25,1,1,0,
i would prefer to see the older one as well for now ill give you the point but please attach the older plan as well,25,1,1,0,
its ready but it still comes across very confusingly not sure how the data connect with the calendar some orientation for the user would help,25,1,1,0,
lots of pages lead to navigational dead end please fix them before proceeding to further feature implementation point was not deducted considering the teams situtation,25,1,1,0,
other than that i think the app is at a good state and is on its way to being finished keep up the good work,25,1,0,0,
since the two prototypes have very different ideas you might want to look for a general commentary than a prototypespecific one for your comparative analysis,25,1,1,0,
the quantifying of your observations may not hold since youre changing more than 1 feature as mentioned in the comments to the previous rubric item,25,1,0,1,
the text and profile page are not optimized for mobile they shrink rather than being responsive the profile page links also do not go anywhere,25,1,1,0,
they are all the same idea your prototypes are also the same idea just different facing directions stemming from too much similarity in the storyboards,25,1,1,0,
woah good idea combining citizen science and personal informatics reciprocal benefit for the science and citizen user scientist gets data citizen gets the data analyzed,25,1,0,1,
you might want to verify if having a game factor as such ie a tree that grows for each saving is actually what user needswants,25,1,0,0,
be careful with your two differences in experiment one id like to see the effect of the progress bar and the motivational quotes separately in a8,26,1,1,0,
functionality is shown but far too much styling for simple wireframes wireframes should be rough outlines rather than something that looks like the final prototype screen,26,1,1,0,
i had to look into your json file to find the proper user login but i assume this will be taken care for the user testing,26,1,1,0,
in other words its a little stretchy to claim that people expect that viewing the qa material will help them how to read a graph better,26,1,0,0,
interesting activity its a little unclear how this might fit in to the brief from this submission alone but i like where your thinking is going,26,1,0,0,
interesting observations in terms of thinking about how might an individualized history be distributed among software features this in turn might prove valuable to software usabilityefficiency,26,1,0,1,
interface elements are cut off in chromes responsive mode for galaxy s5 please let me know if it works better in some other browserdisplay size config,26,1,1,0,
make sure to actually use the plan check things off as they are done and have time estimates unless youre really comfortable with difficulty for tasks,26,1,1,0,
maybe you can come up with an idea to further break it down to smaller steps or incentivize users to put the effort to do so,26,1,1,0,
observing activities leveraging on existing platforms has pros and cons what if someone doesnt use facebook how can we expand our observations to include those people,26,1,1,0,

the placing of the buttons on the bottom appear to be pushed out of a few screensnamely the home page or indexwhen put into mobile view,26,1,1,0,
the start mission pages are also different which then adds additional variables to your users interactions will you be settling with one format vs the other,26,1,1,0,
the training and activity icons are not very iconic and are not very clear this is related to the match between system and real world heuristic,26,1,1,0,
there are a few bugs such as the events being added are not clickable some features still not implemented some aspects of the app not responsive,26,1,1,0,
this idea of aggregation is common with many apps since your app encompasses various facets of travel rather than something singular ill give you the point,26,1,0,1,
flow is easy but limited is my meals view sorted by recency also if there are multiple lamb and salmon but am i supposed to look for,27,1,0,0,
good work with the video simple and informative your overall visual design is very userfriendly and the wishlist functionality is well done good work over the quarter,27,1,0,1,

inventory doesnt persist also it would be nice to have more than the battles maybe have a way to relate the battles to reallife emergency preparedness kits,27,0,1,0,
make sure to actually use the plan check things off as you are done and estimate the time needed for each task also think about stretch goals,27,1,1,0,
nothing in account options currently also it might be useful to have some sort of progress for the user so they can see if theyre getting better,27,1,0,0,
text and color combinations dont go well together the text is also not wellaligned and is overlapping each other its unclear what the garden here is exactly,27,1,1,0,
this isnt the best candidate for an ab test as it more appropriately distinguishes users exploring the app comprehensively or not rather than what is really intended,27,1,1,1,

when i go to the profile page the entire page starts flashing and im unable to click anything or navigate out of the page within the app,27,1,1,0,
your second topic doesnt quite highlight a specific community i would suggest focusing on a more distinguished group in the productivity if you want to pursue that,27,1,1,0,
all in all good job i cant wait to see how your app will all the changes you got from the he feedback you received from other students,28,1,0,0,

congrats for the award it easily won a vote among the teaching staff also good job on the app hope youve had some fun this quarter in studio,28,1,0,0,
i could not complete the task since the cancelling functionality did not work the task could have been better designed to reflect the core functionality of the app,28,1,1,0,
i created a new post this took me back to the main page where there are no items listed post that if i try logging out it fails,28,1,1,0,
i didnt even notice that i could actually add an event on the map im ok with the map now but you need to clean up the interaction,28,1,1,0,
i do wish the game aspects were more clear right on the first page from what is currently in place it simply looks like a basic budgeting app,28,1,1,0,
i wish the video wasnt sped up keeping it at a normal pace would have helped me see the features of the prototypes and understand the dialogue better,28,1,1,0,
mostly make sure to clarify how the map works and change to san diego instead of london add some examples that they can click on on the map,28,1,1,0,
nice plan im still not convinced that taking a photo of your trash is core functionality what are the data youre using how is this useful to science,28,1,0,0,
not entirely clear who the main users would be i think this idea is very creative but think carefully about the interactions and the goals of your app,28,1,0,0,
please be careful in analyzing the number of button clicks as the number of clickable buttons differs in two versions it needs to be controlled in the analysis,28,1,0,0,
point of view needs to be written from a generic user perspective dont use the word i to describe it it should also only focus on the problem,28,1,1,0,
since no annotation was given as to what the screen 2 is i arbitrarily graded based on the assumption that the list view of courses is screen 2,28,1,0,0,
the main page could be more intuitive and informative you could add some visual artifacts to the front page that could draw interest from potential users for example,28,1,1,0,
the only issue with this is on the dog parks page the maps hijack the scrolling which is not too big a deal but can be potentially annoying,28,1,1,0,
when i start a mission i dont see the puzzle thats supposed to be there theres also not a clear instruction as to how to use the item,28,1,1,0,
clean visual design however for new users the app appears completely blank instead of providing pointers about what to expect to see there which can be a bit disconcerting,29,1,1,0,
each task thats mentioned in separate rows is too big it was mentioned that tasks are typically much smaller similar to the subtasks that are there on your list,29,1,1,0,
even if i did give you the benefit of doubt and consider each subtask to be a separate task i still have no idea who did which sub task,29,1,0,1,
having all the menu buttons at the bottom when its obvious that the users at only one of them at any given moment could be waste of screen realestate,29,1,1,0,
i just noticed that the dates on the discussion page are a little unnecessary or at least dont need to be that big id put an upvote counter instead,29,1,1,0,
i wish the add task button was larger to symbolize that it is one of the major features of the app in general major features should be more visual,29,1,1,0,
nice activity i think some of the observations were too focused on what cooking ware participants used which is a bit removed from the main activity you were observing,29,1,1,0,
one thing to note how can you insure that the user is indeed a legitimate researcher the login page does not check for this and this may cause issues,29,1,1,0,
same feedback about the timers alarms and lists as the previous prototype its also unclear what happens to the pet as you complete or give up on certain tasks,29,1,1,0,
tasks should be a bit more specific for example what exactly are you doing to finish up functionalities also breakdown of tasks among the team seems a bit uneven,29,1,1,0,
the navigation is spartan and too linear what if you dont want to set intervals after accidentally clicking the button also are there going to be any more pages,29,1,1,0,
what do to other tabs in the app do the prototype displayed only focuses on the training tab so im unsure of what the rest of the app does,29,1,1,0,
you switched login and signup and i spent way too long trying to get into your app no login functionality whatsoever ignore what any rubrics say in the future,29,1,1,0,
your task description could have been a bit more specificeg use the app to register a new task so that you can stay focused on the listed school assignment,29,1,1,0,
changes do not align with heuristics such as in 2 where a more detailed summary is said to improve minimal design or 4 where error prevention appears to be misconstrued,30,1,1,0,
having the users type in all the checkpoints at once might be tedious for them you might want to think about how to break down that into several smaller steps,30,1,1,0,
how would you implement quests into this if the goal is just to get to class on time i dont see a lot of room for adding in additional features,30,1,1,0,
i really like the button change made in your homepage and would suggest to make the other buttons on your app follow a similar style eg the buttons under filter,30,1,1,0,
im not sure why clicking submit should log you out even if temporary there should be some indication of what to expect also what is set intervals meant to do,30,1,1,0,
plan isnt reflecting very much progress either youre not working on your project or youre not updating your plan also the home management and alarm functionality is not core functionality,30,1,1,0,
the calendar does very little for helping understand what tasks are and what data they possess you need a better way to visualize and input tasks more data more visualizations,30,1,1,0,
try to be clear who the target user is also see how the app can do more than just store information that could be in a note say google keep,30,1,1,0,
aside from the budget tab its not clear what the purpose of this app is also the home page text is hard to read is this intended to look this way,31,1,1,0,
detailed observation report and it was interesting to see how different users had different cope mechanism of their busy schedules i think lots of latent design opportunities exist in your reporting,31,1,1,0,
generous with point here its arguably sketchy enough to meet the rubric criterion but i would want to see more detail and functionality the interface is fairly bland at the moment,31,1,1,0,
good job it was fun to read the observation report but it might be a little challenging to unify the different aspects of it into a cohesive problem statement and pov,31,1,1,0,
i dont see the difference in the apps linked by the two urls submitted on piazza please clarify also the redesigns need to be in one heroku app just different routes,31,1,1,0,
interesting thoughts but try to articulate them better and we can help during office hours its odd that you mention that your original pov wasnt worded well but dont attempt rewording,31,1,1,0,
is the second page the profile page because its used for the placeholder for other pages its confusing to know if this is meant to be the 2nd page youve completed,31,1,1,0,
nice protocol well in depth and shows respect and concerns for participant i like how it anticipates a users struggle by offering ways to help the participant and wordsquestions to say,31,1,1,0,
ok if youre really invested in the time management idea thats ok but youll have to keep convincing me of the science aspect of it like you did in this section,31,1,1,0,
some bugs when you add a picture clicking on events is not specific i think you forgot a curly brace when you go to the page after clicking on a picture,31,1,1,0,
some styling notes make sure to include more margins your text is currently all the ways at the edge of the screen add in some padding to make a cleaner design,31,1,1,0,
video is a bit too long at 111 it could be shortened by cutting out some of the dialogue from the beginning as the main focus should be the app itself,31,1,1,1,
work item such as implementing unique interactions redesign menu icons or code two screens of the application isnt specific enough please break it into smaller and more detailed and quantified items,31,1,1,0,
i can see similarity between the books and movies interface but the interface for fitness might have to be different make sure to add more interface and be prepared for heuristic evaluations,32,1,1,0,
interesting idea but as shown in the observation recording their lives might entail many different aspects and we might need focus on and unify some of the needs found from this assignment,32,1,1,0,

your development plan looks partially completed there are a few tasks and they are not specific ie implement the fake one what exactly are you going to add to the login page,32,1,1,0,
another note is that the application seems to depend on people of higher position to actually make a change how can you remove this dependency that allows students to actually make a difference,33,1,1,0,
as i said try to think about the accountability and goalbased budgeting features that could set you apart from other budgettracking apps in addition this could make your app more motivating than others,33,1,1,1,

I like the postit design for tasks. But I am not sure the efficiency of drag action. Maybe adding a voice input to the system can increase the speed of performing certain tasks.,33,1,1,0,
"I might expand upon the weight graph, also overlaying it with your dietary information and workout schedule from days before to grant the user some intuition into how those factors affect their weight",33,1,1,0,

similar feedback as for the first prototype i know you are thinking about this but be careful not to make this an informational guide think instead how to empower trainers in connecting with their pet more,36,1,0,1,
"Since the user is using the camera, maybe allow the user to record or take pictures? Just an idea I had that allows users to go back to a certain Hololens demo they thought was cool.",36,1,1,0,
some of the prototypes interface is limited how do users navigate from the sign up page how do users log in from the log in page how do users manage different companies on the 4th page,36,1,1,0,
There is no save button for the predefined modes of lighting. And throwing movie in between evening and morning is kind of random. You can also set a time for different modes to turn on automatically.,36,1,1,0,
This could get messy so might be a good idea to find the most useful features (possibly ask some people how they note take) and collecting the most popular freatures into an easy to use API.,36,1,1,0,
This is a very good idea because most of the students want their notes to be clean and clear. It's a good idea to offer scientific method to mark down their notes and improve the efficiency.,36,1,1,1,
very thorough and detailed observation report i really enjoyed reading it it conveys lots of design opportunities is engaging by telling real stories and serves its best as a qualitative piece of writing in my opinion,36,,,,
"Waiters often don't have two hands to interact with a watch. So, if a waiter is busy, he could shake the watch instead to signify that he wants to pass the service alert to someone else.",36,,,,
again drop the redeemable prizes they just dont make sense especially at this stage of development id rather see more gamelike functionality like an avatar levels and skillsattributes to increase by playing the other citizen science apps,37,,,,
assignment instructions explain that the development plan should be included within the pdf submission itself rather than a link so that i can compare tasks done this week to the tasks you originally planned the week before,37,,,,
"Because people may use dish washing machine everyday and the range of users is large from different cultures and ages, it's better have a clean and clear interface that people understand how to use immediately without learning.",37,1,1,1,
"For interface 2, I wish you can place the message on the right of the picture, so students can look at the pictures and the message at the same time. It may looks more organized and intuitive.",37,,,,
"For the Yard scale, I don't see much necessity to put the sound waves graph at the lower half part since it looks like you don't have interaction to control or edit using the Yard Scale display",37,,,,
"Great job with the design, it definitely looks very clean and organized. I'd recommend replacing the announcements, scripts, and videos with actually relevant content to the comic book creator (also that script font isn't readable right now)",37,,,,
"I am wondering how would the augment reality goggle work since I don't think people will wear the goggle while sleeping and if not, I am not sure how would the display show the information to users.",37,,,,
"I don't know too much about it but I am not sure if a progress bar is the best way to display something like judges found, think about what you want users to do with that information.",37,,,,
i dont see any difference is that a mistake if so let me know on piazza also the redesigns need to be in one heroku app just different routes but you didnt lose the point for this,37,,,,
I like how you show the date for the phone interview but the font size should be bigger and with the dark blue/grey background it it hard to focus on. The red does draw attention though :),37,,,,
"I like that you let the user drag passengers around because that is easier and more intuitive than typing for each car. I wish that there were automatic messages, like buttons or options from a drop down.",37,1,1,1,
I really like the blue and black theme of the interface but I think the red kind of throws it off. I would recommend a different color. Also do you need all those ads at the bottom?,37,,,,
I'd like to see the room numbers labeled onto the map. The number seems like a count down until vacancy? Does this include people who might have the room reserved right afterwards? What does the checkmark mean?,37,,,,
"I'm not sure just one picture is good enough to inspire potential DIYers, maybe you could add a gallery of pics or require pictures from different angles to give people a better idea of the item requirements",37,,,,
"It is a good idea for people who extremely care the format and layout of their notes. By using this note helper, they can save time by avoiding decide which format they should choose to take notes.",37,,,,
"Not exactly sure of everything that it can do. Which makes this part hard to critque. I know that it is for reading articles from the desprciption you gave, but maybe a more clear video would help.",37,,,,
"Not very well thought-out. Posture detection seems implausible, watch seems to not provide useful info, and the wall computer seems to not be related to the foot or inch interface - how does partnership add to posture?",37,,,,
The app seems to address an issue which is very prevalent in collegiate life - as well as everyday transportation regarding a community. I can see this app being very useful to a wide audience of people!,37,,,,
the colors are kind of jarring also the sliders and images are not optimized for mobile remember that you are developing a mobile web app so all images screens should be optimized for a responsive mobile design,37,,,,
the meaningful thoughts about heuristic evaluations is very generic it could have been done better it doesnt talk about how it helped you in particular or how you were able to help the other team in detail,37,,,,
the second prototype is unique however an application that just blocks distracting websites can be too superficial and may be difficult to implement research more into how to motivate your users to stay focused on their studies,37,,,,
the start date may not be too important to fill in so maybe that could be automatically populated also let me know what deviceapp to test your app on it appears too small in chromes responsive mode,37,,,,
think about deadlines so that you are on track each week also mention some stretch goals try to have tasks distributed across members instead of saying all since its unlikely to have all of you code together,37,,,,
A map is nice but what happens if there is an outlier? I could see that skewing the suggested hostels and possibly missing content. The list view could maybe expand when the user isn't interacting with the map.,38,,,,
"Doing some research and rearranging the grid of the overall design might also increase readability. For example, on the tablet, changing up the grid might make it easier to include more information that is helpful to the user.",38,,,,
"Eyes tend to gravitate from left to right, top to bottom. Unless you want to emphasize the layout over the stat info, you might want to consider switching the orientation of the stat panel and the house layout.",38,,,,
"Foot - I'm not exactly sure what the camera, security, and appliances have to do with the app - from the persona, it seems to be about light energy and savings. How does a camera tie into this?",38,,,,
"Going off from the comment above. I think the purpose of this application should be helping people developing the habits of not procrastinating, and break from the entertainments decisively and focus on their school works whenever they should.",38,,,,
honestly its a great idea and app but the navigation is incomplete such as relying on the browser back function when a more explicit cancel equivalent button is required also how to quit a workout in the middle,38,,,,
I like how all of the face data and the daily process is written on the yard scale. I wish you had the option to order products online. You can add that in the wear to buy section.,38,,,,
"I like the separation of fridge and freezer but I do not know if that is important for the purpose of your interface, which keeps track of all food, so maybe you can have them together at first.",38,,,,
"I like the way that it monitors that there is a personal/ professional balance, but it may be tough to keep up with because I wouldnt type in ""computer time"" I would probably just go on the computer.",38,1,1,1,
I think it is a great idea to have the UI information box pops out to tell the related information of a photo and I think tthis can be a greatttt user case for museum or photo exhibition,38,,,,
"I think your lights display is a little overwhelming. Since you're already gong to have a brightness scale, maybe you don't need on and off buttons? You can get it to dim all the way to turn of?",38,,,,
I wish it was more visually appealing. I know it's hard with vim editor but is there an easier way to see the different commands? So a newbie programmer can quickly see what they can do with vim.,38,,,,
"I would like to see the modes automatically update based upon previous settings. For example, if I walk into my usual coffee shop then my mode will automatically update based upon my last visit to the coffee shop.",38,,,,
"I'm not sure how in depth the task names are, but it would be cool to be able to view more details about a certain task for clarification in case someone isn't sure what a task name means.",38,,,,
That's amazing -- three types of switches in the same keyboard. It would be really interesting to see what kind of keyboards could be designed for these lead users -- computer science students who code or game often.,38,,,,
the one thing i wonder about the functionality is that the user could just click the same thing over and over again maybe there could be a way to increase the challenge after users choose a certain action,38,,,,
"The tablet screen is split between two uses- actually viewing the art and viewing its info. I would have the main screen be either the info or the art, and scroll or swipe to bring in the other.",38,,,,
try to be more clear who the target user is going by the video it could be either students or even as broad as anyone who doesnt cook often and relies on frozen meals ie it is ambiguous,38,,,,
video doesnt show the other side the java tutors side in this case of the story this is important because perhaps a user who hires someone can also offer hisher services to other people on the same platform,38,1,1,1,
"When you are designing your interface, it's better to offer users freedom to customaize their sections and notes since different people may have different ways to mark down their notes, but you can give basic guideline for them.",38,,,,
you didnt need to draw the web browser ie url box search box etc just whats on your app you put detail into all of the wrong places a big button with identify your plant is pretty meaningless,38,,,,
your open in map button doesnt do anything even after moving the circle i dont have any information about the actual crime activity also you need to specify a legend within the app describing what each color signifies,38,,,,
also how does the vertical feed interface of the buddy system differ for each of the parties does the left column represent me and the right column represent my buddy can i have multiple buddies for the same task,39,,,,
"AlsO, ambient sound cannot be a better way of providing immersive experience to the user, to let user better tasting the old ages showed up in the photo, especially when it is an iconographic photo that has significant meaning.",39,,,,
"At each scale, it is clear how each box functions. I think with color and different fonts/weights, it will be even clearer and you can remove some of the cluttered text to increase the overall readability of each interface.",39,,,,
be careful about having todo lists as these sorts of apps end up being gamified lists maybe think about the idea of microtasks and how you could make a game out of completing microtasks in the scheme of macrotasks,39,1,1,0,
"For the foot display, it might be cool if you can pull up you and your friend's schedule. Then find an event that can fit both your schedules. That way it automatically filters out events that you can't attend",39,,,,
"For the foot interface, the profile picture for the user does not need to be that large because it does not relate to the task but takes space. Use space to show as much info for restaurant as possible.",39,1,1,1,
"Have recommandation of food for inch or foot interface if possible. Because there are large amount of people who do not know what to eat, the recommendation section can help them to decide. Good to have featured food section.",39,1,1,1,
how is the priority computed if different users have different ideas about how the priority is computed for example we have measures such as due date approx hours difficulty progress can users create a custom way of assigning priorities,39,,,,
"I can see why you'd want to see which seats are taken in a room and what the slides are for a lecture, but I don't think you'd need to see them at the same time on one interface.",39,,,,
"I definitely like interface 1 more than interface 2. Interface 1 is more convenient and familiar because users have already been trained in using their phones, whereas it is more confusing to have to learn a new interface(interface 2).",39,1,1,1,
"I felt like the home page of your design is a little bit non-necessary because it can be in the the same style of your next page design, or just be a add-on notification part in your second design.",39,1,1,1,
I like how you used a smart mirror interface for the yard scale. I wish it could offer feedback on your routine. It could watch the gestures you are doing and offer advice if you are doing it wrong.,39,,,,
"I like your design of the watch interface. However, one thing that confuses me is that in the watch interface, what does the nnuber represent if I just watch those numbers instead watch at your explanation on the right.",39,,,,
"I particularly like the use of VIM keycaps to help ease cognitive load with a scaffolded artifact. As a gamer and content generator myself, I use mechanical keyboards all the time to help improve my typing and response time.",39,,,,
"I really like the idea behind this. I think people definitely need to be able to visualize the furniture in their room. For your prototype, it is a little hard for me to tell exactly what the picture does?",39,,,,
"I think the idea is interesting. Having the ability to block out certain noises is certainly a useful function. In the next iteration, I would like to see some automation to the process itself and some specific use cases.",39,,,,
im still unclear as to how the racing component might motivate users why would users care about beating an avatar wouldnt users be able to achieve the same thing if they just set an alarm for when to leave,39,,,,
"It's unclear to me if the entire column is clickable or just the labels with the icon on top. For example, if I click +3m, will it highlight the car option? Or I have to click the ""Now"" label?",39,,,,
its not clear who are the target users overall interesting idea of using social collaboration as a form of accountability as i said in my feedback in person i think some goalbased quests might be good for this app,39,,,,
other than that the major functionalities are there which is good sign moving forward i would encourage your team to iron out your major known bugs and to finalize the interactions designs of your major components keep it up,39,,,,
The queue is a nice idea in case you are late and don't know if your order has been called already but I think you are giving too much information and it is taking up a lot of space.,39,,,,
using items in the garden dont persist so its difficult to see the causeeffect between item interactions its also a bit confusing to understand that you are working with other people to keep your garden maintained through your budget,39,1,1,1,
you should want to wireframe your important pages its not really clear what your app does because contribute doesnt mean anything especially when it looks like you are just submitting a task and whether or not you completed it,39,1,1,1,
based on this storyboard i would just develop a better calendar also where do you think the game component might be useful in this how might you address this efficient timekeeping in a way that doesnt involve calendars or alarms,40,,,,
comparison was supposed to be made at the violation level you confused this rubric item with the next one on reflection you could have also talked more about the brief how did they compare in actually meeting the design objective,40,,,,
do you plan to filter as per the wireframe or sort companies think about which other columnsinformation you may want to give the option to show the wireframe looks better than the table if you just want to indicate status,40,,,,
"For the tablet interfect, I'd like to see just a small map (similar to uber) with prices in different areas that shows where I would need to walk, my total fare, and how long the total travel time would be.",40,,,,
"For the yard size, it doesn't make sense to drag one assignment to the other side. If you want the users know what tasks they have done, it is better to have a clear category to organize all the assignment.",40,,,,
"I am not very sure whether the weather information is a related in formation for for an task like that. If possible, I would wish the button could be larger so it would be easier to for people to click",40,,,,
i like the overhaul styling done to application since i last saw it the application appears to be almost bug freesee my other commentand is working nicely major props on getting a mongo database from the looks of your github,40,,,,
"I like the watch interface. But there are couple things that I feel like you can do better. First I don't think it blue rectangle is needed. If you want to use it for aesthetic purpose, make it look nicer",40,,,,
i like this idea of exploration to produce better navigation results it might also be fun to think about how people can get creative with their location inputs and what types of rewards they can get for exploring different areas,40,,,,
"I wish you can replace the ""Drivers"" and ""Passenger"" in the ""Send a notification"" page to the exact name of the recipients since sometimes you might not want to send message to all of them. Give more freedom to users.",40,,,,
"In order to have more interaction bewteen the users and the phone, I wish you could add a function that users have freedom to turn the project on the phone by themselves in addition to the change by the presentors.",40,,,,
it looks to me that this prototype is catering only a small subset of features that other social media platforms already provide you might want to think about how to answer why should i use this service instead of xxx,40,,,,
some of the painpoints found from user testing are not covered in the list of changes whats your thoughtplan on that please make sure that you hit all the major problems found from user testing for the next weeks assignment,40,,,,
"The initial screen is a little overwhelming. I'm not sure exactly how to fix it but off the top of my head, I think some of your features, like remaining requiremens and course pool don't have to always be shown.",40,,,,
"The traditional monthly view is quite recognizeable and I think it would be interesting to see how you could change that interaction at different scales (week, day, etc) and possibly incorporating little hacks that people use at each scale too.",40,,,,
"When working with padding, I frequently want the right and left padding to be equal. Maybe if you tap on an element, you could have an option to enlarge L and R padding at the same time in equal increments.",40,,,,
"With the large scale of a yard display, you can fit much more information on the screen. It would be nice to display complementary massage movements the user can further explore if they enjoy that massage type or target region",40,,,,
"As I don't really play games, I am not sure if this is the right interface for users. The design to me is kind of confused. Be sure to include the signifiers to improve the learning curve for the new users.",41,,,,
"At the yard scale, I like having the ability to actually see the meal. That's something that is important to a lot of users as it helps make ordering easier if we know what is going to be served to us.",41,,,,
"Especially at the watch interface, I like the simplicity of the design and only displaying very little functionality. I think the icons can be a bit onfusing though so possibly changing how those appear would make it easier on the user.",41,,,,
"For idea 1 interface, I wish you categorize all the filters(requirements) into clearer and cleaner orders and sections. The message on the top would better to put on top of the lists of future requirements because they belongs to similar funtionality.",41,1,1,1,
"Good job connecting the persona, task, and interface.The button on your inch scale is hard to hit and the function of swiping up/down and right/left might messed up causing errors when user trying to swipe left but ended up swiping up.",41,,,,
"I like the layout design, it makes sense and fits plenty of information on screen. However, maybe the left side of the screen could be minimized while viewing individual applications since the user probably doesn't need to see everything at once.",41,,,,
I really like the app! It would be cool if you could click on the picture/name of the person you are interviewing with and it would bring you to their linked in page so you can research them before the interview.,41,,,,
i think something you havent addressed is the idea of creating a routine and reaching goals which is what you focused your pov on be careful of making this feel like another mint app how might you move beyond inputting budgets,41,,,,
"I think the tablet view has the right kind of personalized input into the app. The TV view might be able to be more generalized since it is meant to be public, so there could be more collaborative views between people.",41,,,,
"I wish that there was a better reason to keep the Personal section. I would rather look at my calendar for that. Here's how you can fix it. Remove personal section and keep the app as a ""searching for"" app instead.",41,,,,
i wish the app had more help and documentation in other words perhaps a how to use page to cater to new users i would not know at first that you can customize a list a blocked websites in the settings,41,,,,
"If you want to generalize your Yard display to be able to record more types of music rather than just singing a song. Instead of showing up lyrics, you can also showing up the stave or music score for musical instruments.",41,,,,
interesting and diverse activities and interaction observation i think theres big design space related to enhancing and maintaining the current work efficiency flow but making it less cluttered and making space for new tasks work contexts to be stored good job,41,,,,
ive been a fan of your idea and i think you have a nicely polished app i think the next steps will be to flesh out the functionality and try to separate your newsfeed section from other photo apps like instagram,41,1,1,0,
my main suggestions for improvement would be to make the fitness pov more explicit and more fleshed out in the app interface and to improve on sizing of text and images for both desktop and mobile views good work this quarter,41,,,,
need to be able to add a task and have it show up add more simple widgets to collect additional information no need to make the analytics page update with data just put more charts and other visualizations of more data,41,,,,
"Not sure about the snooze button. I think the most important thing is that if I were a video game addictor, I think I need to cultivate the will and habit of breaking out of the video game without any hesitation.",41,,,,
The user could be passively using the applicaiton and a notification could pop up when the price falls within range and it could notify the user where they need to go in order for them to find the lowest surge price.,41,,,,
theres a minor bug when pressing the back button if a user navigates to the members page clicks back to group and then the upper left back button they are navigated back to the members page instead of the home page,41,,,,
"When users are in certain page, it is better to have an indication on the top bar for certain item. For example, if users are in Donations page, you can emphaze the term by color or larger font or bold font.",41,,,,
"Which interface scale is this UI being presented on? it's not too clear from the video, or what type of setting (at a desk, in a car, etc) the app is going to be used from. Will it require internet access?",41,,,,
"While the idea may have some attractiveness to people who don't need to worry about security, the presentation of this idea is not fleshed out. It looks like a set of slides rather than a UI that I can touch through.",41,,,,
Yard: I am not sure why there are 4 blocks that say gilman and myers if the person is already there so maybe switch it to one block? Also black on white is typically not the bets option for reading text.,41,,,,
"At the inch, I like the abiltiy to solve a simple puzzle. Also having different puzzles would be a nice addition. But again (I know for me), solving something complex would get hard and annoying especially if the alarm keeps going off.",42,,,,
"For idea 2, I believe it is better to allow students to offer their price. Under this situation, this is a compeitition market. Users may get a lower price with satisfactory products. The compeititon can add motivation and energy to this market.",42,,,,
"Freezing the screen in the middle of the game can be annoying for users. Maybe it can calculate how long a game will take and if it's past the set time for sleep, it won't allow the user to start another game",42,,,,
good for reflection but this isnt the comparison we were looking for it was supposed to be at the level of the violations themselves as for reflection talk more about the brief how did they compare in actually meeting the design objective,42,,,,
great creativity in this idea think about how to make it more competitive or unique from other artsharing apps also target the destressing pov a little more its not super clear form the app itself that this would specifically help people destress,42,,,,
"I am not sure if this is what you want but to make better use the functionality of AR headset, you would introduce more gesture or voice controls to let the user manipulating the object or 3D holograms in the augmented reality.",42,,,,
I like the layout of the inner part without the outtter grey area but I feel like the color scheme is a bit dull especially with the purpose of getting someone hyped up to dance. Brighter colors (and more colors) are necessary.,42,,,,
I like your layout -- you have improved it a lot and it is much easier to understand and look at :). When you click for info about a class it would be nice if it showed the reviews for the professor.,42,,,,
"I love the design, i can see you guys put in a lot of time and effor creating this application. Its very simple and yet i can understand very well. The instructions are very clear and overall a very good job !",42,,,,
I love the idea of a calendar as almost a personal assistant. I think calendars can and will eventually have the ability to learn our habits and interests to suggest and build the optimal schedule that helps save time and increase productivity.,42,,,,
I think it might be a good idea to have the watch vibrates when it detects how the students' seating behavior is wrong. So that students know they should correct their seating position when they are in a long time of work,42,,,,
"I think that this is a good idea for the specific case of hostels. I still think there is major overlap with AirBnB, though. I recall that there was the idea that this was going to be a trip planner type thing?",42,,,,
In terms of the interface for the dispalcher display. I hope that you could add more colors to it so that user can easily distinguish the difference of the interface above and below. Not sure what does the volumn button do though.,42,,,,
"inch - having a map display on a watch might not be the best idea, as most people have bad eyesight and wouldn't be able to easily distinguish map features. perhaps provide step by step instructions, one step at a time instead",42,,,,
Inch: I like that it warns the user when they're about to do something they're not supposed to. The buttons might be a bit close to each other though for an inch interface. Perhaps you can utilize swiping instead of tapping buttons.,42,,,,
"It looks like everyone is getting picked up from one spot, but I think it would make more sense if the pickup location could be set by car. That way people who live closer to each other could travel in one car.",42,,,,
"It would be useful to have a watch interface; I imagine that a student planning a hackathon can be extremely busy. The watch UI could do things like, update progress, assign tasks through voice input, keep track of the hackathon countdown, etc..",42,,,,
"It's a good idea trying to emphasize due dates that are coming up, but the red text on dark blue is hard on the eyes. Perhaps choosing a different shade/color or even a different way to emphasize the content would be better.",42,,,,
"It's better to use the place as the main in the control panel instead of categorizing places to on or off. In other words, set the places on the left for example, and indicate they are on or off for each term.",42,,,,
Maybe you can add a functionality that notifies Drew if his lights has been turned on when he is not home. That way he can know if his roommates have been snooping through his stuff or if someone broke into the house.,42,,,,
the color palette goes off the app screen be careful about this also i think there is too much focus on the customization of the avatar i would have liked to see greater functionality with the racing component that youre focusing on,42,,,,
the under budget on the overview page and the new expense button on the expense page look alike and might be confusing to a user use some way to differentiate as the under budget looks like a button that should go somewhere,42,,,,
the visualizations saved you i want to see more of that side of things show more fake data also these survey questions text boxes theyre kind of big and clunky wrangle in the design of the surveys more also more quantitative data,42,,,,
what does the sword icon mean at the bottom of the avatar page what are the options to navigate to within the hamburger menu the main features were captured but the full interactions of the app arent too clear in the video,42,,,,
when a specific interface ex paprika on mac os was analyzed the scenario in which the user actually interacts with it is also provided alongside which ultimately led to some design insights that reflect human actionsworkflow which i thought was very nice,42,,,,
"When I first see the tabs at the top, it's unclear to me if clicking on one takes me to a different page showing different information or if it's supposed to be a filter option for the same information on the page.",42,,,,
Your user is possibly leading the way for more user centered news articles which makes it clear just how much of an impact the news article or restaurant or whatever you're looking at has had on the community with which it's in.,42,,,,
from the profile page theres no way to go back to the main app the back button doesnt work also some of the icons are not immediately clear what they mean this is related to the match between system and real world heuristic,43,,,,
good job my suggestion is to not tie your needfinding work to a specific platform and find scenarios that can be more generalizable other than that i really liked the experiment you devised and enjoyed reading how the subjects reacted to your request,43,,,,
"Having both buttons the same in terms of color and font size, etc. increases the chances of pressing the wrong button. Perhaps you could bold ""Submit"" and choose different colors for the two buttons or even laying it out in a different way.",43,,,,
i actually think the pet idea could be something interesting in the space of productivity but at the moment the idea hasnt set itself apart from other productivity apps that center around inputting tasks setting a time and having an alarm go off,43,1,0,0,
i think this idea is more unique than the previous prototype data input or collaborative route mapping could potentially be a useful and interesting idea be careful about focusing too much on map features or the physical things instead focus on human behavior,43,1,0,1,
it would have been nice to see people in their morning routine even as a sketch while the depiction of the technology they use in getting ready is nice it would be nice to see actual people or sketches in their morning routine,43,,,,
"It's hard to tell if these are buttons or a text field and how to interact with them since the box around ""Video"" is the same as ""Submit an answer..."" and ""More answers (3)..."" I would consider different ways of representing these pieces.",43,,,,
menu for round table has an item with no name some restaurants have no items the navigation bar is inconsistent sometimes a link to about appears and other time it is not available also the about link leads to an internal server error,43,,,,
not all functionality works for example i cant set a place to go on the map or change the alarms and i cant change my avatar the achievements also make this seem more like a fitness racing app than what you are intending,43,,,,
"On the foot scale, I would add a video of the fight as well. The inch scale would be too small for this, but I feel like there is enough real estate on the tablet to display the fight if you scroll down.",43,,,,
"On the inch scale, I think that the percentage and the visual doesn't give me much information or feedback on what I should improve. I would suggest have separate bars for your shoulder, neck, and hips to be more specific in your feedback.",43,,,,
"On your inch scale, the screen looks like information display, but doesn't offer any indication on where to tap on the screen. You may want to add a button as indication. I also don't know what the vertical scroll will lead me to.",43,,,,
one suggestion is that currently on the find missions page the missions are all laid out horizontally which makes the margins of the screen very narrow it might be useful to make it more of a scrollable list or a standard grid layout,43,,,,
please let me know what deviceapp this renders correctly on or fix it for chromes responsive mode i wont be able to award the point in the future also just the list of clothes without the title like in the wireframe is confusing,43,,,,
the interface seems very cluttered with a lot of features maybe think of ways that you could simplify the app while keeping the core idea of it also remember that it should be optimized for mobile which will limit your screen real estate,43,,,,
the prototype does not show the full cycle of how a user goal is created achieved does it only show the current status would users be willing to know whether theyre getting better the velocity of their effort for example and potentially archived,43,,,,
"Two things I think that is essential for the scenario is that, the device that EMTs people are using to send messages should know the current location in real time, so that EMTs people don't need to spend time on describing the location",43,,,,
"Your content seems scattered. If it could better align to a grid, it would have a cleaner appearance. The 3 columns could use more white space to separate out the different panels. What is the ""My"" button on the upper right corner for?",43,,,,
your pov does not seem to be addressing the core problem explicitly i would encourage you to be a bit more specificeg accessibility to news is difficult for many because of insert reason here having better access will create a more wellinformed community,43,1,1,1,
a generic consent form without necessary adaptation shouldnt have been used which is why the point was docked if i cut a point for the same reason last week let me know tip user testing is best done on a target or representative device,44,,,,
add more visualizations the simple text display is good for showing that you can update the data accordingly but right now it doesnt reflect any changes made also add view and set are heuristic violations the user will have no idea what they mean,44,,,,
good job fixing the navigational error and completing some features will put this app in a great shape please review some of the comments you received in the design studio some of the language used in buttons and so on is not consistent etc,44,,,,
great start i want to see the community aspect fleshed out more how are the data being used to help identify plants how will you show this analysis to the user let the user interact with their own data and the communitys data better,44,,,,
i feel like the ui elements that are used in the create meetup page is not the best ones that you can use for example using multiple text boxes to input data which have day month is not the best way to do things,44,,,,
i think your observations are relevant for soliciting hypotheses questions from citizens like they could upvote questions they think are most important to ask and everyone can submit questions for scientists to answer what if we did citizen science without any scientists do that,44,,,,
"I wish you can add a small video or demo after the users connect to the hololens that shows how to use the phone to view the project. Sometimes users may not know the meaning of the graph, so video can provide intuitive guidance.",44,,,,
"I'm not sure what additional functionality the yard scale brings. But the look of it is very nice. It is clear you put the effort into these mockups! The Dog is also cute, but you have conflicting mascots with the smiey and the dog",44,,,,
insight is not clear as it a very general statement that does not have much to do with your findings try making it a bit more specific also its okay if it does not sound as wise but ends up being of more use,44,,,,
"People usually only buy shoes if they think they look nice. It's cool that you make suggestions based on a foot scan, but there are only three shoes shown. I would add more room for the shoe suggestions, and maybe show an on-foot preview",44,,,,
"The design is minimalist which I like. I wish that the watch didn't have so many options and buttons for such a tiny screen. If it is just for viewing purposes, maybe controls could be done via voice. Love the use of a mirror.",44,,,,
"To add on to ^^, maybe you could automatically log the user out on set intervals and force them to do a dance. That might be inconvenient, but if you need an app to just remind yourself to move around it might be necessary!",44,,,,
"Using an old fan out of a PSU is an effective solution to this issue. However, it lacks creativity. For lead user and their innovation, it should be something like new remarkable tech or design idea that will push the whole market go further.",44,,,,
what does the hamburger menu at the top lefthand corner do unfortunately there are only forward navigation demonstrated in the prototype i could not know how to go back to the main menu or the previous stage when i made a mistake for example,44,,,,
"yard - what does ""control on"" and ""control off"" mean? How does it relate to which lights are on or off? What do ""10% electric"" and ""2% utility mean""? 10% of total electrical use last month? 10% less than the average neightborhood electrical usage?",44,,,,
you might want to think about what is going to be lost from removing the physical artifacts paper resumes for example from the interaction some recruiters might want to jot down some things quickly so that they can look for the candidate efficiently later,44,,,,
again how does this app differ from things like mint the one difference i see is the wishlist but i dont see the full motivational value of the app think about goalbased budgets or some way to reward users beyond just showing them their budget,45,,,,
I like how you found outlines of shoes to make your prototype realistic. I also like how you used the shake functionality on the Apple watch. I'm not too sure about what the purpose is of the competition between two people on the year scale.,45,,,,
"I think changing and combining the different noises (white, brown, etc) would be the most relevant for me personally. It could automatically change to your preferred setting upon entering a new location. This would help keep me in an ambient mindset even on the move.",45,,,,
"I think that this would be better off being angled more towards a multi-user experience. E.g. you would create an event and invite all your friends, then everyone has a centrally located information hub regarding everything about the upcoming trip in one easily, accessible location.",45,,,,
"I understand that there are lots of part of lighting control but I still wish that you can make the interface cleaner and clearer. Currently, the interface is a bit messy and it takes me much time to figure out the boundary for each section.",45,,,,
im wondering if there might be a better way to convey your idea without a basic map at the moment it looks more like a standard navigation app maybe the homepage can instead be the missions page to convey more of the exploratory game aspect,45,,,,
its fine since youve shared readable images of the prototype on piazza however if this were to be presented you would lose the point also a prototype shouldnt have too much placeholder text or squiggly lines and use sample text from a typical situation instead,45,,,,
perhaps think outside of the box to figure out how your application is different and useful for your userswhat specific niche does your community need offer compared to yelps how can you alter the design to put a more specific focus on insert feature etc,45,,,,
the idea behind this prototypes interface has some novelty for sure but some part of the interaction is confusing for example how a buddy can send a reminder does she have to constantly monitor the application to tell which one to remind herhis buddy of,45,,,,
the observations were detailed but the specific breakdowns and successes of each subject were unclear an example of a breakdown would be what did drake struggle with when he was writing notes by hand what advantages does drake have by writing his notes by hand,45,,,,
the subjectivity of heuristic evaluations can be very helpful though because it allows you to think about all your users and the problems each might have with your prototype that said the constraints of the heuristics may in fact be a limitation of the process,45,1,1,1,
there was one minor bug that i found so make sure to fix that before testing also the app can use some polishing with the aesthetics perhaps add a border to to do history and add task to make it look more like a button,45,,,,
This is an interesting and very real problem space! I've done what Patricia has done in using Google Maps to pick a hostel and plan trips since there's nothing out there that really helps solve this problem. Looking forward to seeing your design for this!,45,,,,
try to make it more glanceable so that you know how progress is going tasks should be simple enough to not require an extended description also plan for at least one week ahead of time from next week i might have to dock points otherwise,45,,,,
as i said in studio i really like the idea of using random encounters or short bits of time to collaborate with someone on a task think more about how people can utilize their physical space or how to better bring people together to work collaboratively,46,,,,
"At the login page, I wish you can delete the sign up button because you already have two choices for users to chooce, donor or recipient. You can make them as two buttons and click to register. Then, users do not need to do two steps.",46,1,1,1,
Foot: I like that the search results show the relevant information someone might be looking for when finding a restaurant (especially wait time). It's also cool that you can view the actual location of tables (useful especially for date planning) and the menu while you're waiting.,46,,,,
"For the first interface of inch size, I like the circle idea. However, the design is not consistant across all inch size interface. I believe it is better to have same design for comparison since it helps users to better understand the meaning across all interfaces.",46,,,,
I am not sure what is the number means in your inch scale interface. Probably you need to add some words or lines to explain the elements on the watch because it will become a problem when someone is new to the device or football games.,46,1,1,1,
i cant figure out a way to change the alarm also make sure your app is responsive to mobile currently you have made your screen very small which when scaled on a mobile screen makes your app just a tiny rectangle and virtually unreadableusable on mobile,46,,,,
I really like that the user can move the boxes around with the five finger pinch. I would consider adding an option where the user can hold down the box for a certain amount of time and then the app is movable. Similar to iPhone apps.,46,,,,
i saw that a future feature will be to have users create multiple lists of blocked websites do you think this important feature should have its own button so remove out of settings i do agree that settings is a bit ambiguous and should be renamed,46,,,,
I see that you are going for a cheaper design with using all cardboard but I think you could still round out the design a bit more and add the skii mask band on the back and it would make for a much more ergonomic design.,46,,,,
"I think this is a good problem to tackle. I believe a while back, the microsoft hololens was trying to hint at the possibility of being able to do what you are talking about so maybe AR could be an interesting path for you to consider.",46,,,,
"I wish that there was a different way to interact with the yard scale than a game controller. I also wish that the watch had a different use case. maybe once you are at a location, the watch can give you an audio tour with headphones.",46,,,,
I'm assuming the colors are the different noise levels? I don't know if its super intuitive. Might be better to do light blue to dark blue or something? Are the checks available rooms? And are the times how much time is left before they are free?,46,,,,
"In your task you say that the user would might just turn off the alarm instead of stretching and moving around. If you allow the user to choose between entering a password and dancing, I don't see anything preventing them from taking the lazy way out.",46,,,,
Love the ability to either stay at the current location or walk to a certain locaiton for a lower price. I think predefining the range (5-10 minute) walk and allowing the users to input a price range that they would like to pay would be helpful.,46,,,,
maybe its because you decided to keep the first page simple in which case consider the rubric item to be met but there is scope for many useful interactions to be afforded to the user on this page itself to avoid further clicks to get somewhere,46,1,1,1,
obviously you need to make it more clear how the data are going to be generated the data side of things is an important feature too though lets just assume its all one interface where the users can access the data just as a scientist would,46,,,,
the point of view wanders between mental health and breaks in a way that does not bring them together so work on that if you decide to pursue this some of your points in isolation could have very well worked as your point of view though,46,,,,
Very nice UI! My only gripe is with the volume interface. Perhaps you can swipe it vertically instead of horizontally? That way if the user accidentally presses really hard or uses 2 fingers when they didn't mean to they won't be taken to the next screen.,46,,,,
"Hotkeys are the main method I use. I'd love to be able to see parallel pages of notes and quickly move between the two. For me, setting up my notes can take a while so having the ability to quickly set up everything would also be ideal.",47,,,,
"I like how there are clear directions given, however, what if they're traveling somewhere far away? How will all the many directions be made known to the user on the yard interface? Will they have an option to see all of the directions on the foot interface?",47,,,,
i noticed that ryan is on a majority of tasks this is not a problem if those tasks are small and do not take a long time but seeing as you dont include how long tasks actually took its difficult to know the right breakdown of work,47,,,,
i really like this idea but its unclear where the collaborative part is from the prototype alone you should look into jane mcgonigals alternate reality gaming work it follows this similar idea of using your own environment as part of a larger game with random other players,47,0,1,0,
its not immediately clear to new users that they have to hit the button on the bottom right in order to proceed i tested this out with another ta keep this in mind most people just try clicking on the map or the pin on the map,47,,,,
"Not seeing a video link :( Curious to what your solution is though, if it's a reminder app how would it work to constantly remind the user to take a break? If it's an ergonomic hack, what separates this hack from other devices like an ergonomic keyboard/mouse?",47,,,,
protocol is straightforward and shows respect and concerns for your participants one thing i encourage is to allow your participants explore the app after they finish the task this will be a easy way to find any other bugs that you or your participants did not find,47,,,,
some of the screens arent shown for example where will the app take me if i click price or type this is important because 1 we want to be able to conduct heuristic evaluations and 2 see the other important interactions for your prototype ie sorting pricetype,47,1,1,1,
The inch scale visual design lacks any indication about what information it is showing. The user could interpret it as batteries or something else. It could show a really zoomed in heatmap (at the neck or back) to show the problem areas that need to be fixed.,47,,,,
this storyboard doesnt convey the motivation component of your pov it says there needs to be a way to keep track of time but this storyboard would have me believe that a simple timer is the solution how would you differentiate yourself from a simple timing idea,47,,,,
"We talked in class. I think this is a great case of a lead user. Since the product is mostly in research, perhaps the lead users are people whose needs are not known yet. I really look forward to seeing what could come out of this project",47,,,,
What is the interface? What is the input to the interface? What does the interface control? Neither of your pictures nor your description give a proper example. Is it a stylus? Are there motion captured cameras? How is this any different than a standard 4 -monitor setup?,47,,,,
also the doctors appointment setting is cool but there might be some design space left that we could explore other than that specific scenario maybe by adding extra functionality we might be able to attract users to check their health information more often outside the doctors appointment scenarios,48,,,,
Good idea to find a cheap way to let both the User and the Spectator have a deep experience with Holograms. I really like interface two because it is necessary for conference participants to choose avaible in booths around them. It gives them more freedom without extra Hololens.,48,1,1,1,
good job extrapolating your observations of users of specific apps and platforms ie kakaotalk etc however some of the needs having different appsplatforms sounded similar to me and by collapsing them into a couple has led me to decide that the number of needs didnt meet the criterion,48,,,,
"I really like the idea and would find this extremely useful. It seems like a very feasible project given todays technology, however it seems very similar to Google Lens as you mentioned. Besides being restricted to a more specific domain, how does it differ/provide a lead user tech?",48,,,,
"If hololens is popular in the future, there may be lots of devices around the users. Therefore, I believe the system is hard to detect which the device user want connect. I wish you can add distance info and users can know which device is correct for connecting.",48,,,,
"If Ryan is drawing on the Wacom that's in the center, I wonder if his arm or elbow will be resting on the surrounding screens, pressing random things in them. Maybe there should be a lock button for certain screens so he doesnt have to worry about that",48,,,,
interesting activity to observe i think there are design opportunities related to how people associate with each different website and thinking about the human factor involved in how people collect information and interact with it in the internet space might lead to some great ideas keep it up,48,,,,
"It mind be a good idea to have the watch interface detect user's heart rate, and gives warning if the heart rate is above the danger threashold. Also, one suggestion is that it might be better to just have white color font over black background on the watch.",48,,,,
some of the pages of the prototype manifests a confusing flow of interaction for example what does the sign in and sign up button do what about the next button on the home screen how does it differ and how does signing in affect the flow of interaction,48,,,,
The outline reature is really interesting. I think having the ability to quickly see how your notes are organized is ideal for quick and orderly notes. I would also like to see the folder that the notes are organized in and the ability to switch between different lectures.,48,,,,
"The produce, dairy, meat, could be removed and instead just cycle through all of the items initially (produce, dairy, etc. could be a sort method). It would make it easire to just see the items expiring soon since that's what your lead user expressed as the more important.",48,,,,
there is no way to navigate within the app back to the main screen from the placeholder wikipedia pages this makes navigation confusing within the app a better way to place a placeholder page would simply be a blank html page rather than redirecting to an external site,48,,,,
also what happens if there are multiple goals to achieve simultaneously is it that users have to manually divide whatever the financial gain they obtained into several groups and assign them to each goal the process of how users input the data other than creating the goals is missing,49,,,,
i know you guys mentioned that you were concerned about falling behind on your functionality so i recommend finding a way to either scale back by finding a different way to implement the core gameplay or finding a way to wizard some of the more customized components youre planning,49,,,,
i like the idea of bringing context to your health situation by using the information about your family members i think because the hospital visits could potentially be very rare and irregular it might be harder for the users of your service to form a habit out of it,49,1,1,1,
"I like the way you display the information about incomplete tasks using the Gantt style rather than just a list of things that need to be done. Something to consider is if there are a large number of things tasks for just one person, it might be too cluttered.",49,,,,
"I think it would be good if puzzle solvers will have an way to solve puzzles on the wall versus on the ground, as it might be less tiring to look in a forward direction and think. Long time of staring to the ground can be bad for health.",49,,,,
i think these sorts of task competition type of apps only work well if a group of people are working towards the same goal as in the feedback for the previous prototype i think something that is missing from these sorts of task apps is the idea of accountability,49,0,0,0,
interesting interface regarding how to prioritize tasks but you might also want to see how those initial priorities change over time it might be helpful to observe in heuristic evaluations how users interact with it assuming that days or weeks have passed since the tasks priority has been entered,49,,,,
it is unclear how the user can remove or modify the data she already input also it is unclear how the compare with a friend feature works where does the data come from there is no indication of the process that led to the page 11 of the app,49,,,,
it would be nice to see a list of my incomeexpenses entries or a confirmation that they have been recorded also once i reach the homepage with my avatar the context of entering in my amounts is gone theres no clear connection between that task and the app anymore,49,,,,
only one page of the app is shown and the interaction demonstrated is limited to exchanging contact information or resumes since were clearly wizardofozing the watch app i would like to see more about the rest of the app how users actually use the collected contact information for example,49,,,,
same feedback for this prototype how will you differentiate yourself from other running apps also what is the difference between this prototype and your first one they seem the same except for different interfaces the point of having 2 prototypes is to have 2 different ideas regarding your pov,49,1,0,1,
The estimated time for the homework task does not make sense because it's hard to measure the time for each assignment. A same task may take an hour or two hours based on actual situation unless you have a good way to help users estimate the time for completion.,49,1,1,1,
"The Gap Time bar here seems a little un-emphasized in terms of what times she has gap hours. Sometimes when I'm checking my schedule, I just want to quickly see what my allotted time is. Maybe you can show how much time she has left in her gap instead?",49,,,,
"This is a super cool idea!! I really like the idea of the detachable wacom tablet, kinda reminds me of the nintendo switch. I'm alittle confused on the other parts, it would be cool to have more detailed design in the upcoming assignments !! Overall Very good job :)",49,,,,
too much focus on the solution you already have an idea of what the game would look like which is contrary to the point of the assignment which is to only focus on the user needs point awarded because you justified the relevance of the activity to the brief,49,1,1,1,
when you say uses like one page more than another is this just from their own selfreport the purpose of the ab test is not to ask users if they like a page but to see if their behavior within the page reveals that ie through button clicks etc,49,,,,
"$20 is the original price without the surge right? If so, the box containing ""$20"" shouldn't be designed the same way as the +$7 and the others in that row. It should be in its own container and maybe bolded or a different color to distinguish it from other numbers.",50,1,1,0,
also i heard that panoramio locr or flickr equally allow their users to upload geocoded pictures or to add geolocation information online using the exif format some of the newer cameras are equipped with the feature you might want to check out those and make a comparative analysis as well,50,,,,
"As a smash player, i really like this idea !! When im at tournments, i can see myself using this application when im not at the venue. It would be also cool if theres more features on the applications. Features such as replay, highlights and kos. MANGO FOR LIFE <3",50,,,,
"Definitely one of those high tech interfaces ! I love how it directs to you on the foot design. I think it is extremely cool!. I think for the watch interface, maybe add colors or symbols to show what pages are you on. I got confused on which is which.",50,,,,
"I think it might be better to just have how many days left with noticeable numbers on each application versus a progressing bar like thing. For companies that has rolling policy, then you can add the start date and notify user to fill in the applicaion as soon as possible",50,,,,
"It would be great to have some icon to distinguish the Delay, Ambience, Reverb, etc. part since it makes it easier for user to identify the one they want to control. Similarly, for the violin, Drum, Harp, etc at the button, it would better to replace the word with pictures.",50,,,,
"On the tablet, I tried something similar to a relax list before, and I find that if I wanted to do something I just do it. Maybe something could be added onto this to specify what I *should* do to relax, whether than provide a list of possible relaxing tasks.",50,,,,
"QR Code is a creative addition! However, QR codes tend not to be very common among users (Klemmer has some knowledge regarding this). Would your user really know how to work with a QR code? Would she rather just input her phone number and have the info texted to her?",50,,,,
"Something that's bugging me is this: Will the user actually care about how much time they've saved? In my opinion, it's not something that will inherently mean anything to them. If you really think it's crucial, maybe the time saved could be displayed more functionally? Perhaps as a progress bar?",50,,,,
what i see from all three storyboards is essentially the same an easy contact info resume sharing interface using a smart watch what we want to try here is not only to imagine variations in user scenarios but also to look for very different angles of solving the same problem,50,,,,
"I love how you can select the teams' logos, however it doesn't seem to be well-aligned with your grid. I suggest drawing out a plain square, matching it to the grid, and then have your logo align with the square, so you can see how much space is being taken up.",51,,,,
i need to be able to see a history of my own recycling vs garbage you can just make a table for each category try simulating using a post that another user has made instead of making a new post for each item that way its more community driven and convergent,51,,,,
interesting activity i think it could have been interesting to experiment whether or not the subjects immediately visit their facebook account to dig up their memories from the past when asked show me one of your memories from year 2012 instead of requiring them to use facebook in the first place,51,,,,
it is unclear what the exact quantifiable measure you will be testing is a more concrete explanation would be to say that you are testing for example different add member buttons in your group page to test whether users understand the purpose of the page and add members to the group,51,,,,
"Love your idea !! It would be super cool if this can not only be like a school supply interface, it would be cool to use as a party hosting app. For example, users can use this interface to keep in track whos bringing what and who bought what item. Etc.",51,,,,
"Love your idea, sometimes i hate to look down on my tablet and look up to look at my computer screens. I also like how this idea is very futureistic, im alittle confused on the other panels. What can they do ? Can they be on the wacom as well ?",51,,,,
Maybe you can add a function that put a corresponding track on the transcripts when the users are writing notes since the transcritp is long. Sometimes I forget which line I need to track and take me a long time to find what I currently focus on after writing the notes.,51,,,,
the app is looking great i like how the icon corresponds with the app name blockit make sure to show off the icon and more importantly show the name of your app on all screens i also like the pug rolling aroundso cute i see what youre trying to do hahah,51,,,,
the video is 54 seconds long and only shows a limited scenario the aspect of people coming back to hobbying after some time and how this app can help them to pull some valuable insights out of the collected information as you stated in the pov isnt shown in the video,51,,,,
collaborative budgeting is interesting but think about why people would care how their friends are budgeting or care about a garden a way to pivot might be to think about collaborative goalbased budgeting where groups can budget for a collective goal that might be more motivating for people to stay on task,52,,,,
"For the tablet scale, if the user needs to follow the steps in order, you can present one at a time. Once it has been sufficiently completed as informed by the (assumed) sensors on their clotings, then show the next step (you can still show ""step 1 out of 4"" for progress).",52,,,,
i could not reward you a point because there are some dead links for example dead links my projects in the menu button leads to a broken file links to publications of collaborator list of collaborators records of presentation and help john help you in the project description should all be implemented,52,1,1,1,
i may have found a slight bug area of confusion in your navigation after clicking on edit for a task and then pressing the back button in the navbar i was expecting to go back to runpage but was instead navigated to taskscreen an additional back click brought me to the runpage,52,,,,
im curious to know how does having inaccuracy and invalidity involved in her fitness blog affect her i notice that she modifies the description of corresponding picture to make her blog look more attractive to public and this modification of personal events and data lead to inaccuracy and invalidity to her history,52,,,,
"Instead of using a white fill for the restaurant options, use a black fill, red border, and red text. But for the selected restaurant, use a white fill, red border, and red text. This makes the non-selected restaurants ""fade"" into the already black background, and increases the contrast of the selected restaurant.",52,,,,
"ok I think I see now, after like 3 minutes of staring at it It is not clear that there are YouTube videos in the screen like I did not get that the user task was they can use the TV to open a YouTube video for some perhaps an instructional video",52,,,,
"Really love how the design turned out! It's clear and easy to distinguish what are what. I love how everything is in order ! However, it would be nice to have some other thing on the watch interface because i feel like puzzle 1 can be alittle hard to read on it.",52,1,1,1,
the app looks really good compared to how i last saw it good job on the progress the app looks very polished and has a very consistent style the interactions that your team planned created are all translating properly i encountered one minor and major bug both noted at the other rubric,52,,,,
There isn't really much I can see since I cannot see your design. But I am really really expected to see how your idea would work out because I think it is a real issue that people need to be worried about and I am long time seeking for solution for this.,52,1,1,1,
"Using a character with a lower ASCII value than an alphabetical character is quite the life hack - I myself use file-naming conventions when organizing directories of broadcast packages. I place a 0 before the name of the most recent package, so it is always listed at the top upon directory navigation.",52,,,,
Viewing the news or getting recommendaitons on new places to explore through social media is a great idea because I also symphathize with your user. News sites offer very little user input in their articles which makes it hard to get a good idea of just how impactful the article/situation can be.,52,1,1,1,
"At the yard scale, I like the ability to play an interactive game. I think having some simple morning workouts would be an interesting interaction (pushups, situps, etc.) as well. This would definitely get my blood pumping and combined with the morning playlist, I would find it extremely hard to fall back asleep.",53,,,,
"Awesome design, it looks incredibly neat and effective. I love what you guys did with the colors, i feel like its very coordinated. However, its a little hard to read for the yellow text. Maybe changing a darker color could solve the problem. I also love the contrast between dark blue and white.",53,,,,
for example one can think that networking can be made more efficient if the applicants had more information about the pool of applicants or how their skill set compares to what the recruiters are looking for and therefore they can selectively apply to positions that they have a fair chance of getting in,53,,,,
i like how clean your app is it still has some bugs so please make sure to fix those before user testing i still wish that there were images of the food items and restaurant also remember to add a label for your filtering as that might confuse your users overall great job,53,,,,
I love the idea of allowing the user to go on the most efficient route in any grocery store. One of the problems I see often are a lot of people get lost when they go into a grocery store they've never been to before. I love how this app addresses that problem!,53,,,,
"I really like the design of how this app is set up, but one thing I'd mention is to be cognisant of the colors you choose. It's not too clear what each color represents, and they should be consistent across interfaces (red for bad, orange for ok, yellow for mild, green for good?)",53,,,,
I'm not sure the user needs the name of the types of waves being blocked. Also I think sound waves are all one type so I'm not sure what the purpose of have types of waves is. Even waves of the same type can have different sound qualities and different counter sounds needed,53,,,,
"In your remianing requriments setion, I wish you could list all the courses relative to that topic rather than just giving the category, because students may want to see what classes they need to take excatly. Most of them they don't know what classes are under that category. Make the section more intuitive.",53,1,1,1,
it seems a bit odd to me that so many more users were on the card than the page i dont think this necessarily skewed your results but its something to consider given that 24 users visited the card on one day whereas the page only got 5 users total over all days,53,,,,
it would be beneficial to look at how users actually use the app if consolidating the fragmented information related to your hobby into one place and therefore letting the users manage or track their hobby statuses easier is the goal of the app i think that goal isnt evident in the current design,53,,,,
pg 3 and 4 give me the idea of having a general platform for scientists to put out simple surveysor even citizens this would include citizens in the scientific process they could design their own surveys and publish their results all within the app consider going this route if you like the idea,53,,,,
"Rather than the players having to manually input the scores, it would be cool if the game automatically sent the scores to the interface which updates itself. Maybe at the start of the game when it sees the player, it can scan the phone & controller too and know which scores to update.",53,,,,
"The hole is only for one direction. However, if you want to clean the entire sink, you need to open hole in all the directions. It may reduce the power of water stream because you need to open many holes. Probabaly you can come up some ideas to solve the problem of directions.",53,1,1,1,
comparison was supposed to be made at the violation level you confused this with the reflection part this applies to the next rubric item the length reduces its usefulness at the very least break it up into separate paragraphs talk more about the brief how did they compare in actually meeting the design objective,54,,,,
"Going off from the idea of voice control, instead of just showing visual information when user asked questions, it might also be a good idea to give audio feedback: for example, have the headset as a tour guide to explain the background of this picture or explain the things that might insterest the user.",54,,,,
"How are the 3D models just floating alongside the tablet? What allows a floating object to become a monitor object? Where do the announcements come from? In addition, it was explicitly stated that allowing for an editable interface (translatable and scaleable interface elements) was not allowed, or a ""cop-out"" from an actual interface design.",54,,,,
"I don't think it is a good idea to ""enter"" the number of reps for a specific workout on the watch size design. Why don't have it to be a good default that would most like fit the user, and give them couple like two or three other choices to customize a little bit.",54,,,,
"I like the contents you've showed in your video because they are all relevant to the information that user need to get his/her day started. However, I would like to see more information like for example the suggested clothing style for today based on the weather and the change of temperature in a day.",54,1,1,1,
I like the idea that people needs a better way to remind him to balance their use of time in school works and video games (and smartphones!!) So I hope this application can be extended to not just video games but all different type of electronic devices that can interrupt our focus on studdy.,54,,,,
I think it would be cool if people could work remotely on the whiteboard. Maybe it could be a smart board that syncs up with computers/tablets and whatever is written on there is also translated onto the white board. I think this might be a good way to add pictures and stuff as well.,54,,,,
"If you decide to keep all the text, try to highlight some lines of text to indicate possible solutions, maybe use green? If I was a user, I feel like I would just skim over the information about how the mechanics work, and primarily look for a solution to fix my specific car problem.",54,,,,
"Maybe you can come up a good interface on tablent that transform paper to digital because people tend to use digital device to mark their note. At the same time, you can refer to your lead user's method to set the format for users' and help them write note in clean and clear way.",54,1,1,1,
One thing that concerns me is that Jeff will spend too much time in bed and still end up being late to class/work. YouTube videos can get lengthy and it can also sometimes put people to sleep. Maybe it can display what his friends are up to on his favorite social media accounts instead.,54,,,,
the idea is creative and interesting i like the idea of bringing the community of students together to make a positive impact however a number of students in our studio noted that the application may seem too negative if you are struggling with thinking of an idea feel free to come to office hours,54,,,,
"The layout for the foot interface is a bit cluttered. It's better to have one main category or one format and combine other elemtent together. Maybe you can use the calendar as the main method to display all the assignment. When the users click the element inside the caledar, other inteface can pop out.",54,,,,
"The task seems to be tied to a different lead user, not Timmy himself. Timmy is more of an average user - as he did not himself modify the stadium seating with an interface. How did Timmy's specific need drive this innovation? Is he having a hard time watching or interacting with the crowd?",54,,,,
"For the Yard display (the one in your third video, might be foot scale, but it looks like the interface is larger than the one in the second video.), I can see that you can select media and the content to read. But there is just so many pixels for your to make use of.",55,,,,
"Good work ! A simple design yet it can be extremely useful. I really like the simplicity, it brings out the aesthetics. However, it would be nice to have some sort of indication of whats going. As a first time user, its a little hard to keep in track what is going on and stuff.",55,,,,
"How cheap would your design be? You could get a cheap graphics tablet for about $15 online. Granted, it wouldn't have all the fancy features of a Wacom tablet but if your user's only goal is to be able to write on the screen more comfortably, then maybe a $15 tablet would do the trick.",55,,,,
"I believe in the lower part of the foot design, there are controls crowds with each other. When since the foot size is not that big and the the dail on the lower part is relatively small, it is harder to perform a turning gesture and also easily touch the slide bar at the button.",55,,,,
I feel like getting the correct dance move can be stressful. Maybe adjust the types of activities the user can do. Last thing I want to do is dance in my office where people are looking. I'm not sure how the leaderboard is relevant. I wouldn't really care about how well other people are doing.,55,,,,
"I like that the visual design is clear and there is not much clutter on the screen. I wish there were more options for choosing shoes since they have aesthetic value. Here's how: for the shoe buying part on the foot scale, you could consider having comparisons or allowing people to change colors for shoes.",55,,,,
"I love this idea, especially it can automatically record my expenses according to current location. Because for most of people, they have a stable routine. They go to several stable locatoins and spend money. In this app, people do not need to enter repeated information when they record expenses. It is very helpful and conveinent.",55,1,1,1,
"I think the watch is too complicated. For someone who is in the middle of singing, they would just want the stop start options. The tablet is what the user would want, and if there is too much electricity in the recording room to have it wouldnt your yard scale be a huge problem then?",55,,,,
"I thinnk this is a good direction, it would be great to gather some feedback from your friends or family and see how then input data into their calendar and seeing how each person differs. I know in my experience, people can be vastly different and to some their calendar truly is a life organizer.",55,,,,
"Overall, I really like the idea. I just think including more visual cues would make it better, instead of relying so heavily on textual information. More cues that make it easier to glancce at the fridge or freezer and know exactly what is expiring soon and what needs to be replaced in a timely manner.",55,,,,
the first prototype seems like a great idea for collaboration among students perhaps dig deeper in how to further strengthen this idea how can this application help the community of users to focus on their studies do students want to schedule meet up times to study together another note how is this different than piazza,55,,,,
Foot: I am not entirely sure when this scale is used since the user is either on their way to class or already in the classroom. If the user is rushing to class he/she will not be able to look at an ipad and if they are in the lecture they no longer need its funcitonality.,56,,,,
"For the inch, I don't understand why Thomas has to even touch the screen. The new ios has the ""hey siri"" feature which would just automatically activate siri. I don't really see why he needs to even touch his watch. Other products like google home and alexa allow you to give commands using just your voice.",56,,,,
"For the yard design, again try to use colors or some other mechanism to show the status of the washing machines/dryers (starting out shaded and becoming white as they finish completion, sort of like sands in an hourglass), as well as probably identifying the time slots of anyone who's standing near the display with different colors",56,,,,
i like the idea of your applicationespecially the upvoting system as that would increase the validity of the notes i recommend your team to look into incentivizing users to submit notes i reckon that many would probably use your appbut lurk more than contribute perhaps look into a reward system gamification to increase participation and submission,56,,,,
im not sure how you would measure users deciding to go to their profile page or not on the first visit you would need to process the data obtained from analytics and that may not be trivialpossible also usually more pathways to a page lead to greater discoverability so this is a weak test per se,56,,,,
"Visual hierarchy is a bit unclear; I'm not sure what the user should be looking at first. To solve for this, maybe you could increase the font size of the titles for each card, since decisions are based off the data on them. This makes the cards more salient and creates more of a visual hierarchy.",56,,,,
also you might want to observe the entire process of networking using this interface assuming its at a career fair for example how would the recruiters use the collected information later would having a simple list of peoples contact information at one place actually reduce the amount of work for the recruiters or streamline their workflow better,57,,,,
although i dont think this breakdown was necessarily automatically inferable from the observation you made i particularly thought this breakdown was interesting the breakdown from this is the fact that the tool he uses excel only shows his spendings and does not show the amount of money he saved from various decisions he made throughout the week,57,,,,
"Definitely Love the design !! Good job. I like how the design is simple but yet its very easy to know whats going on. As a new time user, i find it a little hard time figuring out what is the ""bet"" page. Is there anyway to have some sort of instructions on the app itself ?",57,,,,
great job minimizing the home tasks page on the home tasks page i recommend adding more widgets for gathering data like sliders or radio buttons that you can gather from then display simply on the personal and community pages you can make an intricate wireframe to put underneath the widgets to wizard of oz more data functionality,57,,,,
"Hmm, Interesting. I use coursera myself, and could see myself using it. However, one question: Inorder to use this board, students and teachers must buy it ? Or is it like an interface that it can project on to your device. I think it would be cool to have something like this on an ipad, or computer.",57,,,,
I like that this design is a one-stop place for planning things like retreats with friends. It would be cool to be able to handle money straight from the design too (like a Venmo API or something LOL). Something else to consider is having different views/filtered information for organizers vs participants (depending on the type of group).,57,,,,
i like this idea because it takes something people think of as trivial and turns applies it to a situation where real emergencies happen one thing to think more about is how might this actually translate to real life how might you encourage people to actually build their own kit or understand what to do in emergencies,57,1,1,1,
I think it is interesting to be able to pick classes for the year and then see when they are available per quarter but I also feel like it is easier to do it per quarter. Or see all possible choices that can count towards my requirements and show the different options per quarter for that year.,57,,,,
if you were planning to count the number of clicks on the chat button to gauge how much more people engage in conversation with others theres one caveat mainly that clicking on the chat button itself doesnt necessarily mean actual chatting ie message exchange rephrase it as how much more do users click the chat button instead,57,1,0,1,
"Since I could not get much information from your video, i really don't know how to provide feedbacks for your design. However, I can give you some hint on how I would implement such three interfaces if I wanted to help you or Jason to stay up to date with his favorite publications and blogs. See Below:",57,,,,
"The button that the user has to press when finished with planning doesn't really stand out as an action button. It also doesn't have any words to communicate what it does. I would suggest making it more salient, moving it to bottom right (where buttons mostly are for moving forward), and adding a word label to it.",57,,,,
"I really like how the app is laid out, it's very clean and easy to see the nearby attractions around you. One thing that would be nice to add is perhaps the map if you plan such a trip/iternary so you can see the exact route to take (or an option to export this to a Maps application)",58,,,,
the first wireframe is ok but the second wireframe doesnt seem like core functionality at all you would benefit from wireframing your core functionality like this in other words the actual contribution and data pages wireframe two looks like it might be for collecting data but i dont see that anywhere close to not giving point for this,58,,,,
you mentioned that time spent on the original version was greater than time spent on the new version but you didnt do a statistical test for this you would need to conduct a ttest on the mean time spent on each menu to correctly conclude that there is a significant difference in time spent on the two pages,58,,,,
you should mention specifically how this pov influences the prototype design some general feedback for the app make sure that its very clear what the purpose of the app is and differentiate it from a regular drawing app make it clear how and why this app will aid in lucid dreaming why is lucid dreaming important or beneficial,58,,,,
your pov doesnt quite explicitly mention a core problem but i kind of understand what you mean i would suggest making your pov a bit more concrete next timeeg potential diners often have a difficult time choosing a place to eat because they have trouble filtering through the information they receive from multiple sources apps peers reviews etc,58,1,1,1,
"Clever usage of colors and shapes to indicate the overall progress, but is this really indicative of a game? Yes, people who like a certain team tend to stick together, but what if there aren't that many fans of one team in the stadium as opposed to the home team? How would this app account for a disproportionate ratio?",59,,,,
"For the yard, I think a more visual calendar-esque design would be better suited for this. It takes more work to read through all of the times and descriptions. You said Thomas likes to be able to do things fast so I think a calendar would allow him to scan through not only today's to-do list but also tomorrows.",59,,,,
"Having the watch connected to your heart rate is a great idea as its pretty telling if you're up and active or just falling back asleep. I think just having a haptic buzzing response would suffice as well. For example, removing the snooze button altogether and just have the watch buzz until your heart rate reaches a minimum bpm.",59,,,,
i think brainstorming and reiterating your current designs at this stage is crucial to achieving a successful project at the end please revisit the feedback you received during the studio on friday and come to my office hour or request one if you cant make it on thursdays from 1100 1200 if you need someone to brainstorm with you,59,,,,
"I think that there is a lot of unused space on the main interface and a lot of information being displayed that isn't necessarily pertinant all the time. An example would be the food list preview, it is unlikely it shows what im looking for and I would more likely go view the whole list than just the preview.",59,,,,
Inch: I do not understand the purpose of the first screen but I believe the user alreayd knows where their class is so the second screen does not need half of it to be devoted ot the name of the lecture hall. Instead try enlarging the names so they are easier to click on for directions to the user.,59,,,,
the workout summary page doesnt have a design also some elements such as sign out which should look different from the page title other than just color indicating its a link appear cut out im using galaxy s5 as the device in chromes responsive mode let me know if you prefer something else or fix it for this config,59,,,,
Yard: I like the idea of comparing mutual friends with someone at the yard scale. I think it would be more beneficial to show both people's schedules and where they overlap as well as mutual friends within each class. Sometimes you may not know you have friends in a class until the end because of the large sized classroooms.,59,1,1,1,
"Because this interface will be appeared on the tablet or computer, maybe you can add a section that can modulate the lighting ambience. Sometimes some events are real-time performance. Users need to make sure that the control is correct before actually turning the machine. Therefore, haveing a section that allows users to preview the result can prevent errors from happening.",60,1,1,1,
"I know in class you talked about turning this into an API and using it on top of google docs, this seems like a great idea to me. Google docs has a lot of great features but some of them can be a bit annoying and adding functionality to quickly and effectively take notes would be useful for any student.",60,,,,
"YARD SCALE 1) For the 2nd column, either the items or locations should be highlighted. Whichever you think is more important. 2) There are conflicting points of interest. I'm not sure if I should be paying attention to the large image on the right first, or if I should be paying more attention to the images on the left first.",60,,,,
your ab test does not appear to be quantifiable because it does not seem like google analytics is able to track the described behavior i dont think itd be possible to quantify the order of actions the user takes however you can still ab test the button to see if users presented with this screen would click the button more,60,1,1,1,
although the prototype provides four different categories books movies music fitness it only shows how the book interface might look like the book interface might not be exactly extensible to other categories such as music or fitness can you define checklists for listening to music for example wouldnt the span of the activity be a lot shorter than reading a book,61,,,,
good job getting the selection screen on the upload but it doesnt upload after that it might be nice to implement a camera api for users to take a picture directly in the app but this is a lower priority than getting the upload to work correctly also the like button is only available for the first image of the homepage,61,1,1,0,
I really like that the upgrade does not change the simplicity of VIM. I am able to transition to your upgrade and still feel comfortable using VIM. I see a problem in other applications that change the UI so much that it is like having to learn a new interface all over again. I really appreicate that you keep it familiar.,61,,,,
"Inspired by lead user's creative way, you can come up with default note sections for users to mark down their notes. In your example, it's important to think about how to organize graphs and words and make interface more intuitive, clean and clear. Espeically, when students want to review their notes, they can easily access what they want quickly without confusing.",61,,,,
"Reconsider your task and user - find some specfic problem that can be solved with the design you come up with, based on those found needs. To me, it seems that you just photoshopped your ideal workstation. How is the interface controlled? How do I move the widowmaker? How many CPUs are being used to power this interface? How many displays?",61,,,,
since the point has been docked in a related rubric item you dont lose it here as the implementation is true to the wireframe but that means you still have to work on this from the perspective of the overall project as a 4member team our expectations are definitely higher in some aspect be it design chops user research or implementation,61,,,,
"Changes to the expiration bar would also be helpful. For example, like we talked in class about how different items expire at differnet rates. So visually, how would you display that? Maybe showing text about how quickly the item will expire relative to the other items so the user is confident in having the ability to quickly or slowly eat the item",62,,,,
"I really like the idea of this because I often forget what I am buying at the grocery store. Not sure how I like the taps at the top of the foot interface, I would recommend having them at the left side maybe? I like the deals based on your shopping list feature because it's nice knowing that I am saving money.",62,1,1,1,
"INCH SCALE 1) On the 1st screen, the buttons are too close and too small. This could be difficult for the user to interact with; slips could occur! As designers we should try to design interfaces to reduce the amount of slips and mistakes :) 2) There is too much text on the 2nd screen. Try to make the information more concise.",62,,,,
"Love the sparse interface! Only issue I have is, what is the platform this interface will be used on? If it's a tablet, then I think it would work well. However, if it's something like a watch that you can slap (that Scott had recommended a couple of weeks prior), then maybe the reset and end buttons aren't in the best places.",62,,,,
"Oh Boy! These interfaces are going to drive me crazy everytime i wake up in the morning. I love the idea and how the interface turned out. However, i personally feel like i wouldn't use it because of the complication. I get the idea and such but to me, it's a little hard and perfer to have normal alarm on my phone.",62,1,1,1,
so youve been good for a while but you now need to start fleshing it out more i want to see more data analysis and interpretation beyond just the classification location data maybe show the data to the user what other kinds of data can you collect maybe you can give the user plants to try to find like a quest woahhh,62,,,,
some of the needs sound conflicting from the observation this nap can range from 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on how tired he is but if it helps him work better afterwards it may be worth the time and reebal needs a way to organize his day better so he does not have to take a nap before getting to work,62,,,,
the garden component wasnt that wellhighlighted in the video i think that is your most important part as thats the part that relates to the collaborative and collective pov youre taking with your app the input of information is also important but i think more focus on the garden component and what users can do with the garden would be more important,62,,,,
the only thing i would critique is that you gave a task to each of your participants while this will be good when it comes to user testing the purpose of needfinding is to observe people doing something in their everyday life which is presumably not just writing sequential numbers i think the concept of the activity is on the right track,62,,,,
"At the watch scale, I'm curious how you got to the 'double cheese burger' in the first place? Does it swipe through a few different options first? It could be interesting to see the most popular item being eaten or possible something you have ordered in the past. As it would be hard to start a completly new order on the watch scale.",63,,,,
Great Work! I can definitely see this as an application. Users can just put down what they spent throughout the month and the application will telly up that information and form a chart of some kind. Then it will tell users how effecient they are throughout the month. This interface can be used by wide variety of people. From college students to Adults.,63,,,,
I think the lightbulb icons should be able to indicate if the lights are on or off. The light bulbs should be yellow for on and gray for off so that Drew can just scan over the screen and know what is off and on. He should also be able to just tap on the light bulb to turn that particular room off.,63,,,,
its unclear what you mean by inaccurate search function does this mean their search function gets things wrong you go on to say that they assume the user knows what they are searching for in which case the search function would maybe be insufficient or noncomprehensive which would be different from inaccurate also no thoughts about heuristic evaluation overall included in this paragraph,63,,,,
"Love the design, its very imformative. I'm able to know whats going on and what to do. I like how simple it is, i think thats the reason why it is easy to understand. I also like the square interface on the main interface. Overall Good job !! I wish that maybe less new screens, i know theres alot of screens going on.",63,,,,
Love the idea of changing up how students takes notes. There are a lot of different methods such as bullet journaling and every students has their own variation. I know Klemmer doesn't want a lot of customization for this assignment but note taking methods can be very personal so maybe having a few popular preset options would be good for multiple different users?,63,,,,
needs and solutions are different timeline has a very specific form of interface and is referred to as a solution in the following statements people need a social timeline where they can post all format of history like words photographs videos etc people need a social timeline that keeps the timeline structure yet still able to search and rank according to the sic,63,,,,
"Perhaps one thing you can do to fix this is to use more visual based brain teasers so that he doesn't really have to read. Because if I have a hard time waking up in the morning, I would have an even more difficult time trying to read tiny text and I might just not even bother with it and go to sleep.",63,,,,
the interaction demonstrated is limited the video prototype doesnt show much of direct manipulation of the interface it couldve been better if the scenario it demonstrated was filmed in the firstperson perspective as it obviates the need for any unrealistic assumption such as listening to and looking at someone elses workout graph one gets motivated to work out and start using the app,63,,,,
"Currently, I think there are too many sections on the screen at a time. Most of the cases, I would not use all of them. Maybe the system can be smarter to detect which section the users would use while other sections they would not use and close them automatically. Or you can let the users to choose to close or open the sections.",64,,,,
"For the kitchen part, I wish you can improve the control. The users' freedom is limited because you only provide the choice of even row or odd row. Moreover, because when you leave home, you probably do not want to leave any of that on because of security issue. For this term, you can just have one button to turn off all the elements.",64,,,,
"Great idea! I definitely think you could work in an app (perhaps on the watch) that knows where you want to go, and then tells you what bus/bus stop to take, as well as directions/distance to the bus stop. It's much nicer than needing to rely on 3 different applications, especially on a mobile phone where multitask isn't enough and limits functionality a lot",64,,,,
"I love the design, based off from your persona. I can tell that your visual design will definitely help your grandpa. It's very clear and informative. I'm able to pick up whats what by the symbols. However, it would be nicer to have a proper interface instead of a drawing interface. I think you can bring your design to a far better potential !",64,,,,
Since your main task is to help video gamers balance their time for school and for games. I don't see how the progress chart can help user to achieve that goal. They might want to check their sleep duration and quality but and I think the most important idea is that they need a way to interrupt them from gaming when they need to.,64,,,,
"Another idea for your task is to allow students to post their work online and add some descriptions. Buyers can search and look for the one they like. For this idea, buyers don't have to wait for answers and reply and get what they want immediatly. It is helpful for buyers who have plants already and want to get the pot as soon as possible.",65,,,,
"Another is that they need a really simple, fast and intuitive interface for them to select what type of situation it is. For example, if it is a watch interface, right before the EMT people is about to send message through watch, the watch should already give a smart guess of current situtation, whether it be gunfire or explosion, based on the ambient sound around.",65,,,,
"For the inch scale, it's not clear that the exhibit and panel options are the things you have added to your list. It initially looks like it would contain the entire list of exhibits and panels. Also, is it important to distinguish panels from exhibits on the watch? They're all events to the user. You may want to just show the time and display both",65,,,,
"I feel like there are too many colors involved in the first page. If the purpose is to have them go from highest importance to lowest importance the colors should flow better, the difference between the blues, as well as the orange is a bit harsh. Also the light blue draws more attention than the yellow and orange which is probably not what you want.",65,,,,
i felt like this reflection paragraph focused too much on the type of menu in the prototype i would have liked to also see some mention of the how well the system matched with the real world in terms of their icons and more about how the prototype handled errors point awarded because you did address your findings good insights about the subjectivity of hes,65,,,,
"I wish you could focus more on the layout of the text, maps and images. Because the glasses is small, you need to make sure that the users will not be overwhelm by lots of the information just in front of their eyes. Therefore, it is better to categorize information by meaning or topics or types and create a cleaner and clearer AR glasses interface.",65,,,,
"Its a great application and i can see many people use this app. However, personally, i wouldnt really use this because i feel like everyone is just going to randomly throw their arms out. I doubt everyone in the stadium is going to have an useful application like this to guide their wave. If everyone had this application, i think it would be perfect !!!",65,,,,
treat the user less like a subject i see how youve incentivized contributing sleep data by having these extra features that simultaneously provide data of the users and these useful features that the user will use the issue is why these data are important what are the questions you are asking why are these questions unanswerable to scientists and how does this app help that,65,,,,
Yard: I like the idea of seeing mutual friends in the class but I feel like the cloud with names in it is a bit messy and makes it difficult when searching through and seeing who is in your class. I would change this to different levels such as friends synced from phone contacts to friends on facebook to mutual friends on facebook or something?,65,,,,
"4) The ""Number of people"" should be above the number line interface because the line itself is not salient enough to catch my attention before reading the ""Number of People."" Or you could make the number line more salient by adding color or increasing its size. The estimated wait time should also be more salient because I think it's the most important information on the page.",66,,,,
"Currently, primary you are using th voice guidance in your project. I wish you could think about the scenerio if the users are unable to understand what the AR say and want to read the word information. Because the glasses is very small, it's hard to put too many words on the glasses. Maybe you could create another device if the users want to learn more.",66,,,,
"For the Yard size display, I would imagine it to be a display in front of a bus stop, so that when people are waiting for the bus to come, they can read about some breaking news happening right now on the public display. And the public display could also show some bus information so that the readers are informed about when the bus will come.",66,,,,
good job on this weeks assignment the development is well thought out however the tasks can be made more specific and actionable split of some tasks to make them more specific instead of code homepage createedit groups push notifications button menu button write implement functionality of create and edit groups buttons on the home page etc for next week update your plan to include these changes,66,,,,
great job i like the idea of tying places with memories also letting you create your own map of meaningful locations is novel this might be a little tangential but you might also want to think about what it means have different users different collections of memories there might be an interesting design space to map a location to different peoples different lives ideas and moments,66,,,,
i could not reward you the point because of dead ends and dead links for example dead end when i click the remind button on a task it redirects me to the remind page that does not have a back button back to the task page for example dead links the home and create groups in the menu button of tasks 1 6 do not work,66,,,,
"I'm just worried about the effectiveness at the end. The pressure remains high when the hole just opens but unless you have large balloon, the water will become smaller after a few seconds. In order to clean the sink with powerful water stream, he may need to do it for several times. It's annoying. Probably you can come up some good idea to reduce the effort.",66,,,,
"I'm not really into baseball, so my opinions can be extremely bias. However, i really like the idea of this application, i think not only can this work on a baseball field, you can expand it to other sports. I personally wouldnt use this because i dont really go to baseball games, but it also has the potential for other games. Games like basketball and soccer",66,,,,
"Love this idea ! It's like a much superior version of the yelp. This is definitely going to help users who are having trouble with a new city and they want to go out and explore. Maybe add some unique functions such as if you take a photo of something, then a pop up will appear and explain that photo. Just to make it more uniqueness",66,,,,
nice video and thorough evaluation i like this idea of using a task app to help teams better delegate and complete work this accountability structure is unique and i think you can do a lot with it going forward think more about this concept of accountability and how you can utilize positive and negative reinforcement through the app to encourage people to complete their delegated tasks,66,,,,
your weather page is blank the useful and funny buttons for the reviews dont really do anything also mapsurf has empty slightly crowded crowded buttons they dont immediately update the current status i figured out later that its based on votes but thats not very obvious provide feedback to the user abut the number of votes as of now it just appears to be a bug,66,,,,
"4) It would be useful if, on the yard scale, there was an overview or summary of what the user had input on his ticket. Instead of having many scattered elements on the screen, maybe a pop-up with information like: table #, bar or table, wait time, # of people, and pending. This way, the interaction would be quick, reducing the potential for crowding at the T.V.",67,,,,
great work managing to conduct diary studies but too bad that this was not complete i can definitely see the effort but due to the nature of the study it would have been better if observation was collected for a longer period of time not one day it would be great to have such results leading to need statements but compiling them will also require extra effort,67,,,,
"i can see myself using this application. I feel like now days, its so hard to keep tracks of applications. This interface can definitely solve the problem. The one thing that i might suggest is to see the competitor in the market, i feel like theres alot of application interface like this. It would be cool to have your own unique features . Overall, great job :)",67,,,,
although the number of items presented meets the criterion 15 needs some of the presented needs are weakly connected to the activity observation in my opinion specifically the following is the excerpt that includes the term bank 1 he took out his i phone and opened the bank app trying to recall when is the last time he had used his card by looking at the transaction record,68,,,,
"Are there any particular hacks that this user uses when inputting data into her calendar? I know for me, I usually record my schedule on a piece of paper as I am told about the data then later input it into my calendar manually. I think it would be interesting to see a couple different interfaces for inputting data and then translating that into the traditional calendar view.",68,,,,
"In terms of the alighment of visual design, I think you could better think of the way to maximize the use of the ""field of view"" of Human eye, which is an essential topic in the AR/VR development. Even though there could be infinite number of pixels for you to use in VR, there are still limited amount of information that people can see without rotating their heads.",68,,,,
lastly make sure to keep nielsens heuristics in mind i was able to add an empty task which shouldnt happen make sure to add error prevention messages also make sure to add in messages to show that there are currently no task n their to do to promote the users to add a task and no tasks in their history when they are indeed empty overall great job,68,,,,
"Love the desgin!!! I like how you used red and blue to stand out each players on the team. I also love how simple the interface is, i think that this is very well designed. It would also cool if theres picture for each character, i know mango and armada are very famous in the community, but for people who are not famous, pictures can really help them.",68,,,,
"The tablet scale is interesting and I have already seen restaurants implementing this, such as at 'stacked'. I would normally use it in the restaurant so the function for pick-up time wouldn't really work if you were at the restaurant already. Also, when you begin to pick the foods, having the main or popular meals appear first would make it for an easier ordering experience on the tablet.",68,,,,
"Good idea to find suitable and unique plant pots in this way rather than just using online shops. Compared with traditional online stores, this one allows users to freely express their needs. However, the disadvantage is the number of ""student's reply"" may not satisfy users' needs because students share their products individually but online stores are supported by a big company. They are able to provide users more choices.",69,,,,
"Hm, very interesting idea. I could see myself using this, it is efficent and simple. However, i know this filling out can be quiet bothersome to some people. I think people would rather ask each other on the phone than doing something like this, i could be wrong though! However, it is something that could be very useful to me and i would definitely use it. Great job !",69,,,,
i like the concept of the analogy of a pets health to reallife health an interesting avenue i think you can go with this is how can you use this as a health tracker in addition to a diet tracker many diet tracking apps focus mainly on the dietfitness aspects without really taking into account health or mood you could potentially add something to this space in that direction,69,,,,
"I like the Earth view for being able to check out places. That being said, I think that for your use case it is incorrect. For a use case that would be a user exploring places to potentially check out or visit, this would be ideal. However, if I already know I want to find places in Greece, I shouldn't have many other options taking up screen real estate.",69,,,,
its great that you tied each user action with a specific need its good to be elaborate in general however for the purposes of this assignment you didnt really need to tie those together in the user needs section you only needed to mention the needs as standalone the fact that they are informed by user actions and behavior is implied by your prior observations either way great job,69,,,,
taboo tho 1 is hard to read dont submit things like that in the future fair warning see lis model to explore multifaceted approach out of taboo design space also see how you might focus on different stages such as preparation reflection and action i like in 2 how the message is fairly personalized and more reflective almost like someone wrote the message for him after examining his day,69,,,,
"The inference you're making about the most important aspect of a user's decision on which hostel to pick is its location relative to their points of interest, could be a bit of a stretch. for example, for me price was usually a bigger factor, especially in cities with public transportation. I would do a little exploration into what drives people to choose certain hostels over others in different scenarios.",69,,,,
"There are too many options, which can also lead to content overload. Too many options can lead the user to not make a choice at all. It's confusing that there are 3 ""Submit an answer"" buttons, are they all the same thing? If so, then you should try to reduce them down to 1 (is it really necessary to see 3 ""Submit and Answer"" and 2 ""More Answers"" buttons?).",69,,,,
favorites and not so favorited vs data are heuristic violations rename the columns or just dont name them at all likes vs dislikes suffices i dont think you need to make functionality for removing categories i like the ones you had with basic info about the person and likesdislikes emotion tracker doesnt make much sense overall i think a lot of functionality is missing also its riddled with heuristic violations,70,,,,
for example by observing someone who uses itunes netflix hulu youtube etc altogether for watching movies or video clips maybe you would learn that the primary complaint users have is that it isnt easy to retrieve the information about something she watched most recently if so how can we streamline that specific use scenario maybe designing a search functionality to easily obtain a specific piece of information could be useful,70,,,,
its interesting to look at the mechanical aspects of editingupdating individual resumes but at the same time i wish i could see different aspects of it mainly about the interaction around having a resume discussing the resumes among friends or other colleagues if any and how those resumes are handed off to recruiters also investigating different styles of resumes in found in other disciplines could make the topic more inclusive,70,,,,
the instructions dont give the user a specific task to complete this task should test out the core functionality in a way that gives them a real scenario that they might use the wishlist which you mentioned was a key part of the motivational component of your app seems to be a secondary feature there isnt any focus on goalbased savings which is what you originally pitched your app as,70,,,,
The visual design is both simple and complicated simultaneously. I think there's something good here in that the user doesn't have to click through several layers before reaching the right controls but at the same time it is hard to scan through the app's UI. There's probably a way to strike a balance here (maybe the UI for a certain set of controls gets bigger when you look at it?),70,,,,
"As we tlaked about in class, I think a skii mask band would be a better alternative as it would really help the headset stay on the users head especially with a heavy phone in place. Since your lead user expressed issue with having to hold up the headset, I don't think your solution as it stands now will solve that problem. My solution is the skii band for more durability.",71,,,,
"For the foot design, it seems like you don't really make much use of that left column for My Reservations, and it might be better to eliminate it (Once you reserve a time slot, it might be better to text your phone the reminders/send it to your watch) Also, try to show what happens after you reserve a time slot (maybe indicate your times with a different color on the tablet?)",71,,,,
i like the idea of using an hp bar as an analogy for money depletion i think it can give the user a more holistic view of their budget rather than focusing on exact monetary amounts the next steps would be to think about how can you reward users for staying under budget or saving enough for some goal how can you potentially factor in regular expenses ie rent bills etc,71,,,,
the home screen is not too clear exactly what the app does some basic labels as to what the eggs are might be useful also the information that i input for each dream drawing doesnt appear anywhere it might be useful to also state why those practices are useful or bring them more to the forefront of the app because right now they kinda seem random right after the drawing activity,71,,1,0,1
"I like the simplicity of the watch face. But it would be better there is something to click on after it shows ""Too Dry"" and pH level. It's awkard the flow just stops there. The design for foot and yard is a little bit too chaotic. Yard: Staring at the mirror and reading so many words is very weird. It would be better to have pictures instead of words. Maybe some animations.",72,,,,
I like this because I'm a gamer myself that has poor time management when it comes to games. It would be cool if the app can immediately turn off the game (after they let the user save the game of course) and lock them out so they're not tempted to go back and play. Or have them solve a puzzle before letting them into the game if they REALLY want to continue.,72,,,,
"Not sure how big the product is, but for the lighting setup display, the box might be a bit small to represent the lights if there are a lot of them and would give a hard time to people with larger fingers to accurataley press what they want. Same with the drag & drop sections or the 'Save to Score' and 'Add to Cue' buttons whether they're touch screen or actual buttons.",72,,,,
the feature youre ab testing is fine but were not so certain how your team would measure pacing i would instead suggest encourage you to track where the user clicks when viewing the project that is put a tracker in both the title and title and image for your a and b respectively and determine if the the user was more inclined to click on the article if the image is present,72,1,0,1,
the kind of information the app provides is interesting it covers different body parts and their progresses separately however you might want to be careful whether thats what the user really wants similarly about having users input all the reps they have done if the most interesting piece of information users focus on is hypothetically the part they skipped or slacked off on why bother having them go through that tedious process,72,,,,
"Your functionality does a really good job at keeping the target user awake and no longer sleeping by distracting him. One thing I'd consider is what is the end goal? Is it to just ensure they're awake, or is it to get them out of bed and into getting ready? If you're trying to get them to eat breakfast, the activities should slowly lead towards that, but it depends on your user.",72,,,,
"Definitely love how futuristic this interface is heading. Right now, im currently using Amazon Alexa crossed with a bunch of TPLINK wireless plug. They allow me to control my lights, my tv, my fridge by using voice commands or interface. Its very similar to your design. I recommend you to check it out :). However, definitely love this idea that we can control different things by just one simple interface. Great Job :D",73,,,,
"For the yard, maybe you could display not only Thomas's but also everyone's statuses as well. It can be like those old AIM statuses or even like how Slack does it. This way other people will know who is available to hang out and who is not. This also works in Thomas's favor because maybe one day he wants to hang out with his apartmentmates but his apartmentmates have a midterm that week.",73,,,,
"I dont see how selecting the area and type of massage is helpful using this interface. Does it provide you with instructions on how to do the massage or just narrow down the movements into types of massage positions one can do for that region. It would be nice if it provided video instruction on how to do the motion and more information on the massage, like in your inch and yard interfaces.",73,,,,
"I like that there are checkboxes next to the items to check off, but it would be even more helpful to have a separate shopping list since some items repeat themselves (and have it labeled in the shopping list as to which meals a certain amount of the ingredients go with). It would also be helpful to include recipes. There's a lot of white space that can be utilized in the food module.",73,,,,
"I really like the creative idea of using a controller for the large display, try to consider other options for the other UIs, such as perhaps Augmented Reality with the tablet (holding it up will ""load"" the region through the eyes of the camera), or maybe the watch can ""change the environment"" for the tablet/display. Not too sure what else I'd recommend for the watch, but nevertheless this is a really cool idea!",73,,,,
"Inch interface is too much for an iWatch interface. If the inch interface is used for dirsections a map will not be the best way to show this because of how small it will be. Similarly, if you have the ability to search for furniture at the other sizes, it seems like the current design for purchases furniture at the inch display will just be too complicated for the space you have available.",73,,,,
"It's a good idea to create a plant pot online market. Some of the users may regard plant pots as a kind of art collection. On the other hand, probably most of the users need plant pots because they have plants and want to put them in pots. Therefore, the plant might become one of the most important issue in the market. It is better to have section that is relative to plants.",73,,,,
"Nice to see it fleshed out. Main questions is, if the current user task is to search, then should the screen be refocused on the results and information of the search? I feel like if the answer is yes and it is done on the map, then maybe there might be more information possible on the map. It seemed to me the focus was on the search information, on the right sidebar, though",73,,,,
some functionality issues some of the icons dont link anywhere ie the history or notification icons when i login and go to the missions page i get an internal server error when i try to add a location and click the add photo icon it takes me out back to the map without allowing me to continue adding my location is there some sort of confirmation that my location has been added successfully,73,1,0,1,
two notes i would like to mention 1 not all users can be motivated by a mere notification perhaps add some incentive for the users research what motivates your users rewards punishments 2 what is the purpose of the messaging system is it just to talk to your housemates maybe the chat system could be replaced with a push notification ie if your housemate forgot to take out a trash click remind housemates,73,,,,
"For the foot size design for pad interface, it would be good to combine your functionality of choosing different media (originally on your yard display) and your functionality of showing comments into the Foot Interface. So that you can choose the articles you want to watch, get the recommended articles based on your reading habits, and review the history of the articles you read and share the article to someone who matters to you.",74,,,,
"Great idea! I think an app that could do this definitely would be very useful, as the current Alarm app is quite manual. One interface to consider using would be a watch, as the functionality can be quick and simple (and doesn't require a big UI to function properly), and you could also make the user take 100+ steps until the watch has deemed they've taken enough of a break until it stops again",74,,,,
"Foot: I like the ranking system and the todo list but I don't think there needs to be a list of relaxing activities to do unless those are specific activities the user plans to do that day. Instead it would be nice if the relaxling list was replaced with todos that don't need to be done that day but can be in free time such as making a car appointment, going for a run, etc.",75,,,,
"I super like the idea of putting sensors on the foot. It is just great! But I just feel like lt is a really rare case that people are forced to put up their hands and they have to send the signal through their foots. And I feel like if they are already in such a situation, it is already too late for them to send the signal since their life is already in danger.",75,,,,
although aiming for creating such a habitforming service wasnt particularly the goal for this assignment but because there is a chance that the irregular or rare usage of it could potential harm the usability of the app i urge you to think about how to leverage on or incorporate the social or contextual information into your idea such that you have a compelling answer to the question why should i use health togo instead of xxx,76,,,,
"For most of the case, when you leave home, you probabaly want to turn off all the light to reduce energy usage. Therefore, it is better to have a button that can turn off all the light to reduce effort to turn off lights manually. If the button is the one under the schedule, it's better to put it on top of all the button since it is the most important and effecient position for control.",76,,,,
"I wish you could have a clear way to indicate how users choose the objects they want to see. Because there may be tons of objects, things, people, and etc. appear at the same time in front of users' eyes, it's hard for the technology to determine which one the users would like to know. Maybe you could create a button to calibrate the scale and chooce the certain object the users want to look at.",76,,,,
"One of the things that OneNote does that I really like is that once you have highlighted something in that color or used that text color, that color is automatically saved so you only have to hit the button once instead of clicking in and selecting the color. Another suggestion I have is to incorporate shortcuts that would make notetaking faster. For example, if the user types (!), the app would automatically highlight that bullet point.",76,,,,
you submitted to citizen science but thats ok make sure its correct next time pretty good start try to collect other facets of information thats about all the data you need for finances unless you really motivate a potential correlation of a piece of financial information with another facets information also the budget is secondary to the main function of the app which is to show relationships between finances and other facets of a persons life,76,,,,
"I do believe being able to see and explore other peoples opinions through comments, tags, etc. is a great way to get a new perspective on the article. Something about seeing a ton of comments and people discussing the topic is exciting and adds a sense of humanity to the article. I know in my experience, I love being able to see what other people think because it helps me form my own opinions about the article.",77,,,,
"I like that the user can check if she's getting into the right car or not, but I'm not sure that having to tap her phone against the driver's phone is the best solution. Many drivers have their phones on a car mount which is sometimes hard to take on and off frequently. It might be better to just confirm the driver based on location and how far their phone is from the user's phone or something.",77,,,,
"I not really a big fan of spending hours inputting my schedule, and make changes to it whenever I have a schedule change. Would it be possible for me to just import my schedule decently from google calendar, facebook events calendar, webreg2, and iphone calendar, and smartly combine them together. And give user options to slightly customize some events if they want. But I do think the process of creating the schedule should be simpler and eaiser.",77,,,,
"I think instead of an alarm, which can send Justin into an unncessary panic mode, the music should just automatically pause. The lack of music would be more than enough of an indicatator to Justin. Another thing is that if you're already afraid of wakling home alone at night, you really don't want the app to be alerting you every time a jogger runs past you. You only really want to be alert to actual potential dangers.",77,,,,
"I feel like you are in a big rush when doing this assignment, as the interface across three scales are too primitive for me to get the idea of what you actually want to put on those pixels. For example, therer are a great amount of white spaces on the foot size interface. It looks like there is aa comment section in it but other than that, I don't know what the foot size interface is used for",78,,,,
"I really like all the content your app provides! One thing I'd suggest is perhaps adding the ability for the user to customize or rearrange some of the functionalities (Youtube, Reddit, Daily News) on the tablet/yard displays, or at least have them automatically adjust based on what the user is currently doing. The breakfast section also seems a bit crammed for the tablet, and it doesn't really seem like a UI with a lot of interaction right now",78,,,,
"I really like the ability to see different furniture configurations in a simulation of your house, however, I dont see an easy way to add additional pieces of furniture. I may have missed something but that seems like a really necessary ability. Furthermore, say I don't know that the furniture store has this capability and I come in without a picture of my house, having the ability to costruct furniture configurations in a generic room would be useful.",78,,,,
"I think instead of each person donating 3 pumpkins, Tommy should be able to request an X amount of pumpkins (depending on the number of students) and then people will donate if they want too. It will be kind of like a kickstarter for pumpkin donating. The other thing is that maybe if one class has a surplus of supplies, the app could suggest that the donor donate to another class that may not have as much supplies.",78,,,,
travel log has no popup info for the event the map doesnt work and is confusing its really secondary functionality dont make it the home page anymore just have a map tab and instead a simple table of events is useful enough like the travel log the summary page should then clearly connect with the travel log maybe the map can be one of the summaries i want to see more data collected and visualized about the adventures,78,,,,
"There is a problem for idea 1 interface. If the user' requirements are quick specific and lots of students took lots of time and efforts to make the pots but user only choose one to buy, how about other works that have been created? If there is no better solutions to deal with their works, most of the students will be disappointed and no longer want to work anymore. This market may collapse in a certain amount of time.",79,,,,
"After clicking on ""Call Emergency Contacts,"" I wouldn't really understand what the red and green circles mean as someone using it for the first time, especially for those who are red/green colorblind. Perhaps you can change the text that says ""Call Emergency Contacts"" to something more descriptive since it doesn't really make sense to keep it as ""Call Emergency Contacts"" after you've already pressed it. Perhaps ""Calling Emergency Contacts"" and ""Emergency Contact Has Answer"" or something would be more helpful.",80,,,,
"I wish you could organize the Course Pool by quarter offer. It seesm that currently the order is random. When students are thinking about their four year plan, they care a lot about which quarter the course offer. Therefore, I wish you could have better way to organize the courses to make this section more intuitive. Maybe you could try using categorized section. You can see how cognitive science department organize courses of one year plan in their official website.",80,,,,
it will be confounded with the people who would click on the link anyway because there isnt much to click on in our apps anyway i suspect the effect of your change wont be significant thats ok but if you have another idea that you could make a conditional condition for like measuring the number of users who go to the emotions page after entering in an event making changes around that might help with the cohesion of your app,80,1,1,1,
two suggestions 1 there were a couple of points in your observation report that discussed about the collaborative aspect of the end result of cooking eg inviting friends over what about collaboration in cooking itself this might actually be an interesting design opportunity as cooking as a household is different from cooking and preparing meals as an individual for thyself for example its just an idea and also perfectly fine if you want to focus on the current target audience,80,,,,
"Why not just provide a button like ""Use the nearest bus stop"" to find the route? It takes too much time for a voice to activate this functionality. Also, when showing the commuting time, the number of bus should also be shown or users don't know which bus is gonna arrive first. I would prefer to see all the available buses in the next 10 mins on a single interface rather than two seperate ones, which requires me to swipe.",80,,,,
"From my understanding of the diagrams, it seems that there are 3 main interfaces - auto scan, main interface, and manual adjustment. Why not remove the ""swipe left"" and ""swipe right"" interfaces? Why does the user have to do any of this herself? The app should automatically scan the environment and play the most optimal audio track without input from the user. How is she going to focus on her studies if she has to spend time fine-tuning her noise cancellation?",81,,,,
"The lead user scenario seems unlikely as well - why whould Corrin go to Starbucks to study as a second choice when there are a plethora of other quiet areas to go study at - equidistant from Geisel to Starbucks (fireside lounge, the zone, commuter lounge, PC PCLab, CogSci lab, etc). Starbucks is also not a quiet place - while she doesn't necessarily have a ""choice"" in that noise-cancelling headphones give her headaches, she certainly has the choice to study elsewhere.",81,,,,
"The wall view is nice because it has the dog and probably other encouragement animals. It might be here where the list view is good. I'm a little taken aback by the whole display of the task. Is this displaying something you type in? Seems like a lot of work just for inputing one task, especially since the assignment itself has already been written up. Might be better if it opened a web browser that opened a link to the content.",81,,,,
good job like i said in studio the main challenge here might be the amount of initial work users have to put in order to get up to the speed and be able to use the app how can we further streamline the process of inputting the data of your closet if one owns a ton of clothes for example it would be really hard to convince users to take pictures of every single item in the closet in the first place,82,,,,
"In general, I like the idea of information at a glance. Like Scott said in class, it'd be good if the information was user-centered e.g. might want to bring an umbrella because it is drizzling. For the general all-in-one view, maybe the controls could be less functional since it would be slightly harder to calibrate the exact lighting I want. I might hit another scale or button by mistake. On the other hand, the control is good for specific view and preferences.",82,,,,
"Great work overall! But just a quick question: How would this interface work for more hidden places? I know that the Empire State Building is pretty noticable, but what if the landmark was a statue that wasn't viewable from the user's current position? Could the app give them hints as to where it might be? Could the user use the foot interface to be shown different images of the street she's in that shows where the landmark is relative to her current location?",83,,,,
"I really like your idea that makes use of the Hololens. Hololens is a very hot topic around the world currently. You idea is very unique in this class. In addition to use the Hololens to present your project, I believe you can extend you idea a bit in the future. Hololens is a powerful tool but just few people are using it. Therefore, I wish you could come up some great idea that broaden the usage of hololens in people's daily life.",83,,,,
nice name for the app it has a nice ring to it the app functionality and features appear to be good and well thought out however how might your team differentiate this app from preexisting group tasks todo apps i would recommend looking into the various features of popular apps so that your team could nuance your app from them moreover you can also look at your audience community for inspiration on the special niches that would only be available in cliq it,83,,,,
"I find the list view kind of scary. I like being able to put whatever comes to mind into an app, but seeing the list is utterly frightening, which is why I don't like to do lists like Wunderlist. Google Calendar is nice because it spreads rthings out, orders them, etc. The best one is probably Android's built in notification system where Google itself will pop a notification of a reminder. I think the task list itself should be abstracted out by the app",84,,,,
"I think for a lot of people, safety would be the biggest concern when walking back to their apartment late at night. I imagine people who are distracted by their phones are easier targets for robbers/molestors. If your user is on the bus or another form of public transportation, this would be more useful. Another comment that I have is that the current idea you have for your app is basically your phone. What can your app offer that the user's phone doesn't have?",84,,,,
"Interacting with the 70 inch display seems like a lot of fun when ordering (if the order isn't too large). It could be cool to include a lot of preset meals which would make it overall easier to order something quickly, which is important for such a large scale in my opinion (people can't wait around). Also, seems like the persona for task 3 should be someone adding their order to a queue and getting in line, instead of someone ordering for hours later.",84,,,,
"This is really a good idea. The only problem for this product is the development of technology. However, even though current technology has not been able to support your product, I believe the revolution will go fast in next decade and our life may be totally different. It's great to have perspective of future product. I hope you can add more details to your inferefaces and provide a hint for current technology to improve the way you would like to be in your project.",84,,,,
"Inch: I like the convenience that the inch interface provides. For some of the screens though, the buttons are a bit too close together for an inch interface and could be difficult to tap on such a small screen, leading to accidentally pressing something the user didn't mean to press. You might consider using other gestures or different types of input than tapping for selection. Also, the red font on the gray breakground is difficult to read. Perhaps choosing a different color would work better.",85,,,,
really good start but you can simplify a few things dont focus on the discussion board at all have a very minimal feature for the reminders just a date and tag maybe you can display on the home page if its near but thats stretch goal the suggestions for conversation topics is not sufficient for the brief can you make them dynamic and reflective of the relationship itself expand more on the first 15 seconds of the video what data are you collecting what graphs,85,,,,
"For the inch design, I would like a way to see events that are happening later on during the week. From what I can see here, the user can only see events that are happening immediately at that time. For the foot design, instead of clicking on the banner to add it to the schedule, I would like to simply hold and drag it over. I would like to click on it to expand the information or other options regarding the event, such as ""Who's going?"".",86,,,,
I like how your friend is starting from a completely blank slate and envisioning a brand new way to organize their life. They identitifed a problem with currently existing journals and modified his to fit his individual needs. I like how simple the design is. It uses bullets and tabs in order to organize the content to a way that aids his eyes to read the written information. The use of white space is also very well tought out. The symbolism is simple but highly effective.,86,,,,
"I like the idea of the voice recognition as a way to launch or hide UI. However, when people are visiting the museum, I think voice control might not be useful since museum or photo exhibition in most cases should be a quiet place. So it might be a good idea to introduce geasture control as an alternative to the voice control. A good example would be Hololens' tap gesture to select while user is gazing. Otherwise you could introduce new type of gesture as well.",86,,,,
good ideas on making the app of a competitive nature but think carefully about how to make this different from strava nike or other such running apps one thing that could help in this is thinking about the main purpose of your app is it to help prepare for competitive running races or to help people who dont normally run these two povs are fundamentally different and by better tailoring app to one of these or something else could be useful in helping you find a direction,87,,,,
"The lower part of the foot design are so clustered and crowded and I feel like it is easy for user to miss click on something. For example, the foot design is not that large, so the relatively small dail on the lower half of the design seems like hard to perform a turning gesture. Also, I believe when you are turning a dial on the lower half, it is easy to touch the slide bar and move the slide bar when you are not intended to.",87,,,,
the month visualization of the mood diary could be better i like the emoji representation for each day but maybe you can update what is displayed for the different categories of data you collect instead of emotions have a little picture of the balance pie chart make it so that the user can select different summary statistics to display over each day analytics page is kind of clunky good job with calendar you dont need to put more work into it its pretty clear what its for,87,,,,
This is an awesome idea! I never would have thought of doing something like this. I am not sure how easy it will be to use for a redesign but the simplest thing would be to try and create a plastic version or something with an elastic top so it can fit around different types of sink heads. One idea would be a website for hacking simlpe household problems with cheap items that you likely already have in your house where people can post ideas like this.,87,,,,
"For tablet is the user supposed to be standing up? It's a bit unclear about that (do they stand and hold it?), or is it intended for when theyre sitting down? If so, the user should be reflecting that. Also, why do you number the slider 1, 2, 3, 4? It's a bit unclear why each position is arbitrarily set to a number, especially when a vertical slider might be better to match the body height (and the relative position correlates to which body part posture needs work)",88,,,,
"Going off from the comment above, you should also think of how to make use of the surronding space around the user since the user can freely move their heads and enjoy the immersive experience. For example, would it be a good idea to take people back to the scene where this photo was taken (which can be a 360 degree video)? Would it be a good idea to pops out the 3D model of the building showed up in the photo if it is an important information?",88,,,,
great job on this weeks assignment the development plan is easy to read and eyecatching to better the development plan include the deadline dates and reword the tasks to be more specific and actionable instead of implement unique interactions unique interactions with users and features write display user information such as name birth date and email on their profile page for example if that was your unique interaction for the next update make sure to include these changes also lol at the 1000 hours for creating an app name,89,,,,
great start talk to some ecologists that might find this app useful see what other data you might collect also make a map screen where the users can see where previously identified plants are wizard of oz the data and the gps location data collection this makes the space around the user educational and if they find something new they can turn it over to the community to help identify it also create a reward structure to motivate the users to identify plants this has pokemon go level potential,89,,,,
"I like the idea and task behind this design. I wish there was another way of inputting car and problem information since it may be hard to identify (especially for people who are less experienced than your lead user). It would be cool if you could take photos/videos/audio of your car and the specific problem then upload it to the system which will identify the problem, put it in text form so you know what's going on, and search for a solution for you based on what you uploaded.",89,,,,
"Yard: I like that the waiting numbers and estimated wait times are easily visible. I wish you could see the prices for featured items though. I also wish that estimated wait times for specific numbers were visible since the current estimate wait times seem like they only show the wait times for the next available seat at the table/bar. For the numbers indicating if a table is waiting/ready (yellow/green), consider using a different way to distinguish between the two since there are a number of people who are colorblind.",89,,,,
"Inch: I like that the user will be warned when she is about to do something she shouldn't, like eating seafood, and that she can use vocal input to set alarms (at least that's what I think the screens are showing). However, sometimes, new mothers are not completely about what they should be doing. Not sure if this is something already considered in the interface, but it would be cool to have pre-inputted personalized notifications based on how far along she is in the pregnancy and her current body conditions.",90,,,,
"One important thing to note that is you mentioned the task is to book a hostel close to places/public transportation, but the map currently doesn't indicate any public transportation areas, and it would also be nice to select multiple hostels to compare/contrast their proximity to specific attractions (if my goal is to go to Van Gogh, I need to consider the hostels near there, because for most people they plan their trips around the attractions/destinations they want to visit, then focus on the other not-so-important attractions/destinations that are nearby afterwards)",90,,,,
"For the widgets, you do a good job with your current explanations, but see if there's a way to convey the same meanings in less words (so it's easier to read especially on such a small screen). One example of this would be just flashing 'DONE' or using a green color to symbolize its done In addition, if there's multiple dryers available, it shouldn't matter (just let them request a dryer and assign them one, especially if they're all on the same floor) - minimize the user's need for decision making",91,,,,
great job on this weeks assignment the development plan is well thought out and easy to read two things i would like to add is to 1 update it so that it is more consistent 030 vs 05 hours and 2 reword your tasks to be more actionable and specific instead of create 2 lowfi prototypes 1 home page 2 any other page split the task up to be more specific such as display a list of projects on the home page for next week make sure to add these changes,91,,,,
"I really like the idea of activity to take a break during a period of work, especially when programming. My one issue is location since I personally would not feel comfortable dancing in front of other people. There should be different activities for different locations such as stretching or going for a walk if you are not at home. Another issue is the frownie face when preforming a dance. I like the idea but I am a terrible dancer and it would aggravate me if I kept failing the dance moves",91,,,,
I really liked how non-intrusive your visual design is. The stats and other feedback all live on the very bottom of the screen and do not get in the way of what I am trying to code. I also like how consistent your commands are with currently existing commands. The use of colons and short words as commands make the interaction very familiar and comfortable. The learn mode is also very visually comfortable. The large screen in the middle is very apporopriate since it must grab the attention of the user.,91,,,,
and the followings are the two needs presented that include the term bank 1 students need a way to better understand their bank account data since the students need to know where exactly he went and on what he spent the money the current bank account software provides confusing descriptions of each transaction 2 students need a way to better organize their cards and bank accounts since different cards need to be used on and off campus on different occasions specifically for commuters multiple cards make it more difficult to keep track of,93,,,,
"For the pantry, I would argue to put the date you bought the item as opposed to estimating when it expires. If you do decide to go with this idea, I would suggest for you to keep it consistent and also apply the same item to the items that was purchased from the store. I would also encourage allowing the user to take a photo as it allows for the user to scan through the interface quickly. It would also let older users (such as grandma and grandpa) use the app more easily.",93,,,,
"I really liked the overall implementation of this video, and how it's suited to helping people not familiar with the recipe and guiding them through the process step by step. One thing that would be interesting to see is how harder techniques (folding, minicing, etc. would be shown), as well as when one needs to multitask (boil water, stir the soup, while mixing ingredients, etc.) as I could imagine the audio assistant going all over the place when the user has to do multiple things at once, which could overwhelm/stress the user out",93,,,,
the observations can go more in detail about the breakdowns and successes the subjects encountered for example in johns case what actions did he make that proved to you that he had a hard time keeping track of his diet did he forget to write down his meals and calorie intake or does he try to memorize the number of calories he ate but fails to remember exactly in nikkos case how successful is he with his myfitnessplan why does he lose motivation even though he makes an active effort to use it,93,,,,
2 points of extra credit awarded because of the great visual design super cute animated corgi and functionality good work some things i would be aware of the input expenses page upon creating an account is a bit confusing because theres no confirm option after each item is entered it might be more useful to leave that off until the user enters the main page of the app also its not super clear that clicking the pet will take the user to the store so you might want a direct link to the store as well,96,,,,
I am still a bit confused about what is being accomplished at the yard scale -- am I interacting with the surface or is it simply displaying what I have already ordered? I think having it display in a simple manner what me or my party has ordered would be a nice reminder and a good way to keep the overall order organized (especially for larger parties). People could then have the option to make changes based off of what the yard scale is showing them (e.g. if there are errors or discrepancies in the order).,96,,,,
"The tablet displays a lot of information which is fine, but where there are so many options I get the Facebook Messenger feeling of I just want to open a message and I have to deal with stories, camera, who's online. I think the first step is to make a way for me to know where the controls are in a consistent way, whereas here I see I can use the camera at pixel location (80% X-Axis, 75% Y-Axis) which seems random. as a microexample, the clock interface has a column of toggles. That's good consistency",96,,,,
"Foot: I wish that the relevant information (estimated wait time) is more noticeable. Perhaps you could dedicate more pixels to that rather than something else like the number of people slider. Curious as to the color choice between the ""Bar"" and ""Table"" button colors as well as the green ""Create Ticket"" and red ""Create Ticket"" on the next screen. For selecting a specific quantity, a slider makes it difficult to do that since it's hard to precisely make the circle stop where you want. A slider also limits the quantity of people (what about bigger 20+ groups?).",97,,,,
"For the yard scale, do not forget that the mirrow has a purpose besides interacting with the application... looking at yourself! currently, The interface gets in the way of the mirrors main use. Maybe you could leave the whole middle empty, and using voice commands bring different windows into view to check out their content. Additionally, a yard interface on a mirro may have buttons tat you can't reach as well as not wanting to get ifngerprints all over the mirror, so if I were you I would center the interaction around voice as much as possible.",97,1,1,1,
"I like the idea of easily finding friends in a class but I feel like the majority of your designs can be done with simple texts. I think it would be more interesting if you focused more on finding friends on campus such as when you only have an hour break or something. This way instead of having to text everyone individually and see if they are on campus you can just look at your phone and see where everyone is. Maybe there could also be a way to set a status such as ""free"", ""homework"" etc.",97,1,1,1,
We spoke about this in class but I think there needs to be a way to put the main table at an angle that is more comfortable for drawing. I also feel like there are too many moving parts at the moment. Maybe stick to one big screen that can moved to different angles and then one ipad like screen that can sync up. One idea (not reallly possible in the real world) is to create something similar to the drawing board in Black Mirror. Here is a link to the specific part of the episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yUPyjdVyds&start=415,97,1,1,1,
i agree with your points and the design changes but having multiple changes in one screen buttons design notification feature removal of the image album and the map etc will make it harder for you to reason about what might have led to users potentially different behavior i recommend either separating out those changes to different urls thus isolating them and controlling for the variance or aligning the original version with the new one by applying some of other changes the new one has the latter might be simpler in any ways dont remove the changes you made,98,1,1,1,
I wonder for your first case of a breaklight couldn't the user just type it into youtube for a tutorial? I like the idea of this interface but you need to make it very clear why this is better than just using youtube. Most cases can be figured out through a simple google search or youtube tutorial. I am a bit confused as to where the ticket goes? I understand that you are saying youtube is not a good source but can you give an example where it isnt? or a simple call to a dealership won't work?,98,1,1,1,
the interaction flow is confusing for first time users searching for a movie looking at the detail clicking add coming back to the home page could be one natural flow of using the app but a there is no state update upon clicking add which is confusing for the users and b once the user gets confused she will go check other pages to see if there was a change but seems like there isnt any or maybe i just couldnt find it which implies that the flow is a little confusing check out the video below httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnn2rlpoclcq,98,1,1,1,
taking pictures of trash this actually isnt too far from the brief its just that youre treating the users as subjects but dont have much justification for doing so like if this were a really well motivated and hard to answer question which it might be but you need to convince me then having an app that people sort their trash with and data on that sorting are useful then its fine if you stick with this idea think more about your data and data visualizations what graphs would you want to show the scientist interested in these data,99,1,1,1,
its great that you included a testimonial of the usability of the app interviewing diverse stakeholders including a healthcare professional like in this case is critical to understanding the deeper implication of the app and therefore however this testimonial largely consists of speculation although it provides a special scenario where healthetree can be useful its only logical to think that this scenario was and should have been considered from the design phase of the app without much evidence found from realworld use case however i want to commend your effort and its a great start toward a more qualitative assessment,100,1,1,1,
"For the Inch size design, I assume it is designed for apple watch. I think it is a great idea to preserve your functionality of vibrating when certain breaking news is pushed to your device. However, instead of making it an interface to read the actual article, I would make apple watch more like a reminder to remind you that there is an such news going on (or maybe shows a really brief introduction or title of the article), so that you will know you can pull out your phone or ipad to read those articles when you are on the bus.",102,1,1,1,
"I like the idea of having fallback mechanisms for when users potentially fall back asleep after snoozing the first alarm. This is definitely an issue that I face. I do think the puzzle might be hard first thing in the morning, especially if it is randomly generated each day (could generate a potentially harder puzzle). I know this is for a specific user so this might be find for him. Something else that would keep me up is solving a different puzzle, such as one that requires you to slide your finger across a maze or something that isn't so mentally taxing.",102,1,1,1,
good start i saw that you have a weekly calendar with kindness for each day how informative is that graph really are there more important questions to be asking about kindness and my mood ask more from the user about how they feel what their motivation was for doing it what kind of act of kindness was it expand more on the data and the visualizations focus less on less informative visualizationsfeatures i really liked the minimal input screen with the smileys and the short response box try to cram more information into that input screen without losing the feel it has now,103,1,1,1,
"Great idea overall! One thing I think that would be helpful is to explain what types of commands would be provided (what makes it chosen specifically for them? Do they do a lot of selecting and copying? Do they format their code a lot?) In addition, the statistics is nice, but it depends what the user's overall goal is - is it to increase their overall time efficiency, or is it to learn Vim commands?) I guess it's fine to keep it since otherwise this Vim add on is really simple, but just keep in mind what the user's long term goal is.",103,1,1,1,
"I like the layout and see it as a strong improvement over the wacom tablet and accurately solves the problem you have. One modification I would appreciate is the ability to have the tablet separate from the monitors so that the monitors can be put on a stand and easily viewable. Screen glare is a strong issue for completely parallel monitors, so putting them on some sort of stand (not as vertical as a computer monitor, yet not completely parallel __maybe at a 20-40_ angle) would solve this issue and only necessitate the user to move their eyes instead of craning their neck",103,1,1,1,
"This is extemerly specifc. Well Done ! I'm looking at the interface and i'm able to understand the function of this product. The wordings are clear and I like the picture and the slider bar that represent the work out you are doing and how its affecting you. I can see myself using this a lot when im on a workout plan or just working out for fun. For the watch interface, it will be cooler if theres some motivation sense behind it. Therefore, not only i can use this interface to check my growth, it will motivate me to do better !",103,1,1,1,
"Your watch design is good but keep in mind the actual iWatch is very small, and its highly unlikely you can click the icons / even view them without some squinting so you may want to try a different UI or larger buttons, because the image depicting Khirbat en-Nahas, Jordon isn't going to be feasible when ported to the iWatch. Similarly, clicking on the tiny location markers in the globe isn't going to be feasible, and I'd suggest making use of a swiping UI (swipe left/right to change places within a countries?, swipe up/down to change continents), or Audio to specify a place",103,1,1,1,
"I like the similicity of the design but I am confused by the top results because they seem to go against your reasoning that google search and youtube do not work. My suggestion would be a way on connecting this to car forums such as ones on reddit because while this app could be helpful, at the moment it seems similar to a google search especially with the button for ""Can't find issue? Create a new one"" at this point I would call an auto shop. I strongly suggets thinking about what makes this app different and why you believe people should use it?",104,1,1,1,
your app is very impressive the interactions are really cool however there are a few bugs so make sure to fix them before user testing some other things to improve upon new chat messages should be appended at the end instead of the top and sign up page should have a back button to the loginsignup page just in case they mess up on their email or password or if the email is already in use i noticed there are a lot of notification messages so i like how you guys kept the nielsens heuristics in mind keep it up and overall great job,104,1,1,1,
"Foot: I really like the ""See what your neighbors are cooking"" idea especially if there is a way to join in and cook together. I am still unsure of the purpose for tracking water. Maybe track drinks in general for the purpose of tracking soda, beer, etc. For the exercise aspect I would do something similar to ""see what your neighbors are cooking"" and make a version for exercise. I would also suggest a way to look up exercises based off of what you have been doing recently (and logged) instead of just searching because that can be difficult, especially when you have little experience.",105,1,1,1,
"The functionality is really impressive. VIM is already a very powerful tool, and your upgrade makes it even better to use. I too often have the problem of not nowing specific commands and not knowing if they even exist. By reminding users of commands they have not used, and even providing recommendations and statistics, I would be much more inclined to user VIM as a new user. It would not seem as threating and I would feel like VIM cares about my learning. The learn mode makes a lot of sense and I would like to see more of your UI for this particular feature.",105,1,1,1,
very attractive idea i think there are enough design opportunities for you to design something that users can find a lot of value with since we wear most of the clothes for more than once if not many more times if you can convince users to provide the initial work to take a picture of each of the clothing items that they have for example but you might want to be careful in this approach since there can be gazillions of items that each person owns they might be able to breeze through the steps that come after and actually start loving using your app,105,1,1,1,
"What if there are too many people at the demo session? It would be too crowded for all spectators to point their camera at what the Hololens user is seeing. For interface 1, along with having a camera view, I think it would be useful to allow the user to choose between camera view and 1st person(what the Hololens user is seeing). This way, users that are close enough to the Hololens user can use their camera to see what the Hololens user is seeing, and users that are too far can use the 1st person view to see exactly what the Hololens user is seeing.",106,1,1,1,
Yard: I am unsure of whether the complete button is pressed when the assignment is complete or that means it is already complete. I do like that the assignment with top priority has a larger space on the screen. I am not sure what the line graph represents so that should be made more apparent. Since this is a large screen the music bar should be smaller. Along the same lines I am not sure why the dog is so big if he is simply for voice commands. I would suggest just having the user talk into their watch instead to interact with the yard scale.,106,1,1,1,
"I get that the lead user is probably a teacher who is looking for ways to supply his Halloween activities, but the lead user is ALSO the people/schools who actually signaled a desire to donate. My question is whether this is accurate, because on one hand, if so then it sounds like there is something to examine with donator-side UI. If not, then my question is who will populate the data on who the donators are. I also feel that asking someone to donate to your cause is a large enough request, but having them learn a new UI is an added layer of complexity within the request",108,1,1,1,
"I think the information you are providing is extremely useful to the users. Would there be a way to input what the user wants to work on for the inch and yard designs? It seems that they are mostly for viewing and keeping track of information, but not really for inputting any goals. The foot desing does have the checkboxes for inputing data though, so that is very helpful. I would like it for the yard desing, there was informaion regarding how long to rest for and how much water I should drink and maybe recommend how much protein or creatine I should take. Great job so far!",108,1,1,1,
Inch: I like the idea of finding where someone is in a classroom but the problem is that if the person did not save the user a seat then there is no point in this. Also I feel like just texting the person would work as well. It is helpful to know who is in your class to grab notes afterwards so maybe the inch interaction could just be seeing who out of your friends is in the class and whether they took notes? (Also could be done with a text but sometimes you won't know your friends are in the class because they can be so large),108,1,1,1,
again because your app is just made really small it appears to be tiny on a mobile setting which is where your app would be the most applicable your users might not be able to use your app properly unless it is responsive to different browser sizes you can do this by making your sizes relative rather than absolute currently you have your app measured in terms of pixels px you can make it responsive by measuring your app in terms of a percent for example if you make your app width 50 your app will fit 50 of the screen regardless of screen size making your app much more userfriendly,111,1,1,1,
"3) I think it would be really useful if, on the 6th screen of the inch scale, displayed the amount of time it would take for the user to get to the restaurant from his/her location. I also think it would be helpful for the user if the text on top was more specific. Like, if it said ""Your table will be ready in 5 minutes."" Not everyone will interpret, ""Your table is almost ready!"" the same way. For example, one user might interpret that ""almost ready"" means he has 1 minute until his table is ready, while another user might think that he/she has 5 minutes until the table is ready.",112,1,1,1,
"For the inch design, I like how large the buttons are since they allow me to see the text better. I would add in a menu that allowed me to see my saved events and what events are happening in the future. For the foot design, I would like a way to delete some events from my schedule if I am not longer interested. It would also be really cool if I could add it to my Google Calendar somehow. For the yard design, I love the large graphics and how intuitive the options are. The random button is also a great idea, since sometimes people don't know how to make decisions.",112,1,1,1,
"I'm so confused by the UI because it essentially looks like a written list of supplies and a grid of possible donators. I did not see how the UI helps the user get into contact with the donators. In general, the amount of text in the video prevented me from examining the UI in a progressive video playback. It may have done better as text outside/above the video. I would love to see the interaction between the lead user and the app, but I saw something that looked less like an app and more like a literal pen-and-paper aid. The paragraphs would have been conveyed better as a paper prototype (for example)",112,1,1,1,
Inch: This scale is a bit overwhelming. I am not sure if the watch has enough pixels to deal with all of your screens. I think that for adding new due dates maybe the user could simply speak into the phone. I reallly like the first screen where is tells the user how much time they have spent working vs. having fun. I think it would also be helpful if the screen still showed the time of day. It may be helpful to have a screen that will buzz the user and let them know when they should move on to something else and when they should really get started on an assignment.,113,1,1,1,
"FOOT SCALE 1) There is no sense of visual hierarchy :(. There are too many images that are the same size, which could overwhelm the user. Personally, I didn't know what to pay attention to! Try to increase the size of the images and the current grid to reduce the number of images on the screen. 2) On the tabs at the top, try to utilize small, but salient icons to represent the different options. The reason for this is because humans process visuals 60,000 times faster than text. The small images could also be an effective point of entry! Whether or not you should keep the text on the tabs is up to you!",115,1,1,1,
"Yard: I like what is shown from far away but I would suggest changing the format from a calender to listing the upcoming events for the next week in a ""fun"" format. Maybe also listing what other people in the apartment are planning on cooking and exercises they plan to complete so that you can coordinate with them if you so choose. I would also suggets making the close up screen for two people where they can compare progress and also match up exercise schedules and cooking habits to see where they match. It could also create a little apartment competition to see who can improve the quickest in terms of healthy eating and exercise.",115,1,1,1,
"I feel like if Karen really wanted to procastinate or really didn't want to do the assignment, she could easily take those extra few steps. I feel like there should be a more concrete way of forcing her to stay focus and on task. This also bring up the issues that sometims bad websites can be used for good things while good websites can be used for bad things. For example, maybe Karen needs to use Facebook chat to talk to her teammates but Facebook is a social media website that is often distracting. Whereas something like TED might be really educational but might not pertain to the task at hand and might end up distracting her.",117,1,1,1,
"I like that you added the strap, especially the one over the top for support. Since people have different head shapes I would suggest making the straps adjustable either with somethign similar to a backpack strap or bra strap (just the plastic part for adjusting) or velcro (though it may not hold as well). For wearing glasses, it seems to work well but did you get feedback on how comfortable it was for a 20 minutes period? I know that if my glasses are pressed into my head it would start to give me a headache pretty qucikly. Overall I really love this design! Its so much better than holding the Google Cardboard up on your own.",117,1,1,1,
the app is beautiful i love how yall went above and beyond to add images and animation i would be cautious about the number of text and images on the screen at a time a suggestion would be to turn each section of the project to be hidden in a button so a button to see the video pitch and a button to see the bio the main information is the fundraise and breakthrough so i would leave that outside and not hidden in the button of course you can format it the way that seems more reasonable to you and your users overall yall are doing great i cant wait to see your progress next week,117,1,1,1,
"I think generally this is very nice concept. When i go to the gym, i often find myself reading the instructions and the work area. However, not only does this make me look like a noob, but also its a little hard to keep on since there are so many machines out there. This interface can help me schedule different specific of workout and its very private. It would be nice to have something like: if you weight 160 then lift 200lb, how much is that going to affect you etc. Therefore, not only does this interface tells you where it will affect yopu but as well as how much ! (Of course, theres also diet, calories, cardio bounded to this.)",121,1,1,1,
"The fact that the buttons are on the bottm and represent specific parts of the paper is very helpful. I could see myself taking pages and pages of notes and I would not like to be scrolling through all of them in order to find the section I'm looking for. I like the simple functionality of those ""tabs"" or ""bookmark"" buttons to link me to specific areas. Furthermore, I really like the fact that the tablet is able to decipher the text and automatically partition the information. It makes my life a lot a lot easer in that situation. I could see a lot of students wanting to use this in class, where professors can be all over the place during lecture.",122,1,1,1,
"I wish there was an option to hide the hotekeys shortcut page since I imagine that the user will become well-versed in these shortcuts after a while and it isn't necessary to have them on the page. Maybe once that is hidden, the box with the slides could become bigger? Because right now, it is pretty tiny and considering the amount of text on some professor's slides, it would be really difficult to read the slide due to the size. Try posting some actual slides and see if you can read it easily. Also, is this designed for the laptop or the tablet? I take notes on my laptop at home but I usually take my tablet to class because it is lighter.",123,1,1,1,
"I like that it's possible to control certain features of the blocker, but I wonder that if it is on a phone, why not just make it a full app? I imagine that the inch scale would display some information even as a widget, just like how Google's home screen could display an icon of clouds to display weather. I like that the tablet view has a week view, but I think more space could be allocated for the daily schedule. For example, although the welcome is nice, it is not necessary for a utility app. The TV display seems similar to the tablet interface, which is good for consistency. Maybe display more than one person's schedule so that you can compare people's days?",124,1,1,1,
Foot: I think that if Justin does to UCSD and didn't just move there he probably knows where to get food on his way home. Is this a personal foot screen or is it in the bus? It may be helpful if there was somehow a waterproof version attached to the bus stop (with the assumption no one can steal it). I feel like this scale could simply be google maps. It would be interesting if you could type in the main things you want to buy and it could direct you to the cheapest and best place along the bus route and show you the benefits of each option such as Vons takes 5 more minutes but the avacados are on sale for $1!,125,1,1,1,
"I like how the add-on is rather minimal, but personally as someone who codes in Vim for a lot of programming assignments I feel like sometimes I just need all the window space to look at my code, so maybe having a keyboard shortcut to hide the suggestions/make the suggestions reappear would be nice so it's not always so intrusive. I mention it more in content/functionality but like if my goal is just to finish my PA in time, then I'll learn the fitting command if I don't know it already, but otherwise I'm not too concerned about learning new Vim tricks. However if I'm trying to learn more Vim while coding, then I could just make it appear and hide it again if necessary.",125,1,1,1,
"I think this is a great idea. The fact that it is smart and will suggest commands that I have not used in a while is incredibly helpful. If I don't use a command in a while, I forget it and have to ask friends or look online for a reminder. With your upgrade, I am constantly reminded of old commands and they stay fresh in my head. I also like how users are able to provide feedback to VIM in terms of what they would like to improve. This openess is what would make me want to switch to this platform. The statistics at the bottm of the screen are also very helpful and informative. They are at the bottm and dont cause any distractions.",126,1,1,1,
Yard: It is really helpful to know which bus route you should wait for and which will be faster based on arrival times. Great idea! The farther away screen is similar to the digital screens at the Gilman stop already but having a larger screen is helpful. It would be nice if when you got closer the screen would automatically sync with your typical route home and show you which bus you should take by highlighting it in red. It would also be cool if when multiple people step up to it it would show if the routes are simiar and maybe suggest sharing an uber if that would end up being much faster and only a few dollars since most people leaving campus live near each other.,128,1,1,1,
"Foot: Since I can't ask you about the design I am going to assume they are in the lecture at this point? If so there is no point to the slides on the screen since they can be viewed in the lecture hall. If the slides are synced with the slides on the screen it could be helpful for people that are running late to class so they can watch and hear the lecture in real time so they do not miss anything. I don't think there is a point to having the ""Friends"" part on the bottom since the user is already in class and can also check this on their phone, if anything I would suggest making it much smaller and just the names without the location.",129,1,1,1,
"I like this idea! I have the same problem. Some museums are so big it can be difficult to remember what you have seen. It would be interesting if you created an app that is similar to those hand held devices you can get at museums to guide you through it but simply on your phone where it can tell your location and something will pop on your phone asking if you want to learn about the painting nearby. Also you could make it where you can ""like"" the paintings which make it easy to find ones you saw. There could also be a list of the paintings you were ""nearby"" in the museum so if you forgot to like one you could go back and search through those.",129,1,1,1,
"There should also be a way to hide the transcript because I could see the transcript coming in really handy with certain professors but not so with other professors. Can the student record/save the transcript as well? I would also suggest adding a shortcut that would allow the student to highlight a certain point as extremely important. For example, sometimes professors will say ""this is important"" or ""this will be on the exam"" and it would be nice if the students could have a shortcut that would allow them to automatically highlight that entire bullet point so that they could refer back to it. Another would be a way for students to highlight points they have questions so that when they look through their notes, they could easily identify it.",130,1,1,1,
i like how the updates tab informs the users that they shared a note make sure to include more messages to inform the user what they did and to also prevent errors if i saved a note inform me that i did so to meet the visibility of the system heuristic speaking about sharing will there be a button to share your notes how delete notes right now it looks like you can only save and like include a help button to inform your users how to use your app to meet the help and documentation heuristic lastly if it is important to your users include dates and owners of notes under the notes tab overall yall are heading the right direction i cant wait to see your progress next week,131,1,1,1,
"I like the problem you have choosen to tackle here since I have a lot of trouble finding good places to visit when I travel. I think a search bar would be really beneficial to your search index because maybe Megan is looking for something more specific like cold-brew coffee. Another thing is, I'm not sure if there are many people who would bring their iPad outside. Most people don't buy data for their iPads and so it relies on wifi which isn't stable outside in the streets. Also, I imagine when visiting a big city like Manhanttan, waving around an iPad may invite unwanted attention from pickpockets and theives. It also really highlights who is a local and who is a tourist and that can actually bring up some safety issues.",132,1,1,1,
"I like the idea of having all of this information in one space but It is a bit overwhelming at the moment. I would recommend having a bar on the top or sides that the user can switch between which shows different aspects such as one for rate my professor and CAPS and another for the current schedule. I think it would be helpful to narrow it down by having a page for all requirements left to graduate and then letting the user choose which ones they wish to complete in the given quarter and then directing them to a page which shows course potential offerings that match the requirements. I also think the top left ""waitlist/plan"" should be moved below the time and date of the course so the relevant information is above.",134,1,1,1,
"Inch: I really like this scale tells you the name of the bus stop and how long you have left on the bus, as well as an alarm when it is time to get off. This would be really helpful in foreign countries! I can't tell if the arrow in the 4th to 6th image is directing you or not but that would be extremely helpful. This is especially true when the faster route to school might be a bus that is slightly farther away that you have never taken before. I am not entirely sure what the ""use closeset bus stop"" is. Is it a button or an option or automatically taken? It may not always be best to take the closest bus stop especially when it comes to nobel and regents vs lebon and regents (but lebon does get passed alot with full buses).",146,1,1,1,
"It is really unfortunate that your pictures are broken no matter how many times I refresh the website, so I can only see your design through your videos. For the inch design, it looks like it is designed for a breaking newsm so that the watch will vibrates when there is a breaking news pushed to the device (correct me if I get it wrong, because there is so little information for me to see what is really going on there). But first I don't see why it shows up a time-like number when you press the 'breaking'? I thought it would pops up the article that has the breaking news. Secondly, it is bad idea to pops out an article or any sort of content relates to the publication on inch scale, because it is nearly impossible to read any texts longer than a short message.",147,1,1,1,
"One of the problems is that all 3 UIs do the exact same thing - select a location in the world, and explore that site. Try to branch out into different tasks/use cases for each UI, such as how will multiple people use the display at the same time for the yard scale? Maybe with multiple controllers they can specify/vote on places, or request to not visit specific places, or a place that matches all of their interests will be provided so they are all satisfied. The inch scale struggles the most from not really getting to immerse yourself in the place because the display is so small, so I'd focus on something else, such as maybe the audio functionalities (imagine a narrator describing the scene at each of these places around the world, such as being an excavator digging for a skeleton in the hot summer desert)",148,1,1,1,
"I like that the app is not cluterred. It is meant to be an organizational tool, so the simplicity of the app really pleases me. The tablet is smart so it is able to learn and made adjustments to the formatting of the material. The app gives a lot of space for the user to be able to write, which is really convenient. It has some buttons on the bottom of the screen, which do not get in the way of the user writing. It creates quick buttons that correspond to specific sections of the material, which I would find very useful. I do wish that it would give a few options of how it believes that you want your notes to be organized. Maybe put some ornaizational style examples and have the app shift the information around based on what type of organizational syle or hierachy the user prefers.",150,1,1,1,
the app is simple which is good i think it makes your app easy to learn and use there were some dead ends and dead links so make sure to fix those for next weeks iteration some notes currently the add group button is hidden in the menu and should be more visible addition of back buttons would allow users to easily maneuver around your app adding messages to inform your users of what they did would allow the users to be aware of the system visibility of the system heuristic and prevent errors error prevention heuristic for example if i addeddeleted a group the system should ask for confirmation and then let me know what i did i also understand that yall are having trouble formatting your app so please come by to office hours for some help overall it looks great cant wait to see your progress next week,151,1,1,1,
there are a few bugs with your app so please make sure to fix that before user testing some design recommendations class info can show quarter and year notes can show amount of dislikes and likes and name of the app should be seen throughout the app not seen when creating or viewing a note make sure to keep nielsens heuristics in mind users can make a lot of errors with your app so add some helpful messages when logging out deleting a task unfollowing a class adding the wrong credentials for logging in and entering an empty task i can see the error message in the console but not on the app itself lastly as much as i think the url of your app is unique try to get a new url with your app name before user testing overall i think your app flows well and straightforward good job,151,1,1,1,
"I think that past quarter information should be on a different page. Like I stated above, this is a bit overwhelming. I don't think that the user needs their GPA, name, college, id, etc. on a top bar _ the user knows who they are. Maybe there could be a list of the requirements they are currently able to complete instead of showing a graph and listing all of them in the center. I feel like each block you have created should be a different page. It is nice to have all of the items readily available but that doesn't mean they should all be clustered together. I suggest: 1. A page that shows the top right block, with the bottom left calender and the capes reviews. 2. A page with all of the courses that have been completed, courses needed to be completed and the graph of what courses can be completed.",153,1,1,1,
"This is a really great setup! I also used to do some graphic design some years back and I used a very similar setup. The fact that he uses a tablet to do his main work is a very good idea, rather than using the touchscreen on his computer. I also really like that since he is right handed, he keeps the monitor to the left of his Wacom tablet. This prevents him from accidentally hitting it with his elbow as he is drawing. Furthermore, he is able to use his left hand to type on the keyboard. I also like that he is playing videos in the background. This way he can be more relaxed and feel greater comfortability as he is getting in the flow of his work. Having reference material on the monitor is also a great idea. This allows him to get small bits of inspiration as he continues to illustrate.",155,1,1,1,
2 another idea it was interesting to see how meticulous some people were and that they were frustrated because of the lack of a good way to track their nutrition intake for that matter i think an interesting angle might be to look at the daily nutrition intake history and compute the delta between each data point thus leveraging and reflecting human homeostasis into the process of meal preparation probably a somewhat longer term in this case like preparing meals for the entire week for example this might lead to an interesting design idea that might not just visualize each cooking event as its own but also as part of a bigger group 2 to 3day cooking window for example if you are interested you might want to further observe people and how they might change their course of action provided that they have information about the nutritional intake of the past over time other than that great job,159,1,1,1,
"The video link is broken, so I am basing this on your written description. The content of your idea is very practical. My friends and I regularly use sites like Slick Deals in order to find the best value. I realy appreciate an app alerting me on new deals. T-Mobile does this on Tuesdays through their app and I have been jumping on those deals, so I know this works! I also really like the fact that the app is smart enough to purchase items for you. Sometimes items run out of stock and it would be great if the app would buy it for you before it runs out. I would like to see if maybe the app can ask you if you would like to buy the item though. Or if the app can check your bank account to see if you have enough money. It would be horrible to get an overdraft fee due to this app!",160,1,1,1,
"Inch: Conceptually I think this is an interesting idea, however I do not think that an inch scale device is ideal for viewing images of anything. If you are on the bus, why not use your phone or a tablet that provides a larger scale? Foot: For the foot scale, I think that the use case is much more proper. However, your use case states that the user wants to check something out in Greece. Why give all the options for places around the globe or additional places that the user doesn't want, like Jordan? Maybe provide an interface before this screen that allows the user to select where they want, it animates in on the map and doesn't show other places. Yard: Seems to me like you mostly reused the foot interface for the yard. Watching videos/viewing content on a yard scale is obviously ideal but I think you can come up with more intuitive interactions than using a game controller.",162,1,1,1,
"On the sign in page, the spacing is off, it definitely shouldn't have so much room for the Username/Password especially compared to the rest of the screen. The donor/recipient option probably should be two large buttons , instead of small checkin boxes as opposed to the much larger Sign in/Sign up buttons Assuming this is an app for mobile devices, check boxes in general are kind of hard to work with since they're small, but either two buttons / dropdowns could work as well. On page 2, the sign in button at the bottom's rather small, which always tends to be a problem with a lot of mobile apps (it might want to be near the top, since the user's going to check there first, and either they already know they need to make another account or they'll just login) On the Your Donations page it's not clear which option is curerntly selected between Current Donations, Past Donations, and Tax Write-Offs (perhaps highlight/bold whichever one its currently defaulted to?)",169,1,1,1,
"Verification email should probably have a go to home option because right now the only option is to refresh the app. The donation page's + Donation button should be much larger when there's no current donations, to fill up the space We discussed this in class too on Thursday, but for quantity/deductions there should probably be number incrementer/decrementer options/dropdown menus, especially for common items which tend to be more of a flat dollar option or whatnot. Deductions/category should probably be automatically calculated, and the ""Not What you expected"" is probably honestly an edge case since it shouldn't be that often that this occurs, so up to you if you want to address this specific edge case or not. For Homeless Shelter matching I think your app should automatically match a homeless shelter based on the needs of the shelter, the preferences of the user/location, and what the user's giving away, which would make it much easier and you could even fit it into the previous screen. (The user should confirm donation only after picking a recipient)",176,1,1,1,
"For the inch design, I really like the large text and the green color you used to signify progress. The color filling of the shoes is genius, it gives a great visual of the progress the person is making! My only question is, where would the user input what the number of their steps ""goal"" is? For the foot design, The large graphic is great since it gives a clear view of what the different muscles are. Furthermore, the vertical menu makes great use of limited space. The tabs below also keep the information very compact, while offering a lot to the user. Also for the foot, I like how the interface takes the trouble of subdividing body areas out of the user's hands and guides them towards finding more workouts. The yard design offers tons of information and is very easy to read. The ""wave to connect"" feature is a really good idea, but as a user, I would have a difficult time being drawn to that area of text. Maybe add an image to draw the user's attention to that area.",183,1,1,1,
"Great idea! A smart wallet with the functionality of Mint would definitely be a great idea to restrain spending/encourage the user to budget wisely. However, one potential problem I can see with the usage is often the decision is made to eat/go somewhere before even paying (i.e. I only pay after I've eaten food at a restaurant, not before I make that decision to go to a restaurant with friends, which would save money). For example, if the user overspends their budget in half a month for food, is the Smart Wallet supposed to lock them out and prevent them from spending any more money this month on food? (this leads to circumvention/the app wouldn't work ideally) One cool potential thing could be if this app somehow knew the user's intentions (or maybe at times when the user is likely to go out and spend money it can recommend ideas/suggestions, sorta like the angel/devil on your shoulder) That way it could encourage decision making from the get-go, in addition to showing the user's progress (or guilt tripping them) on how much they've spent recently",184,1,1,1,
"Inch: I like the idea of being able to see how well you've slept using the watch interface but I do not think setting alarms for sleeping through the watch is a good interface, it would be easier to simply have the alarms sync from the phone. I like that you can see what you planned for breakfast to help the user stick to their planned (healthier?) choices but I don't think you need a yes or no for breakfast unless this is meant for tracking? In which case you would want the user to be able to say what they ended up having if it is different, maybe through speaking into the watch? This may just be me but in terms of drinking water your body should know when you are thirsty. If the point is to track what the user has had to drink that is a different story. It is also the same with snacks, I think it is a bit strange to have a designated snack time since it is healthier to eat the snack when hungry. (I may be misunderstanding this.",186,1,1,1,
good job in polishing the app i can see lots of effort has been put into linking everything together and implementing interactivity at every corner of the app i like the detailorientedness however some of the interaction felt a little redundant meaning that there are various ways to achieve the same goal of navigation for example it could have pros and cons but one of the cons would be that it might overload the mental model of the firsttime user as it the flow of interaction does not feel very much linear i stressed firsttime as it might also be true for more advanced users to find that interactivity and detail handy i think its ultimately up to the design teams choice to cut down to which level of focusing on details and implementing interactivity 1 point was rewarded for your overall hard work of polishing the app and finishing the project thank you for an awesome quarter you guys rocked enjoy the winter break and hope you earned some insight and inspiration from this course hope you a great new start for whatever youre trying to achieve next,189,1,1,1,
"I really like the idea of putting tape on the areas people touch their faces to. I think it would be nice if the original package provided a sheet of stickers meant to be placed over the area where a person's face touches it. I believe that would be a very cheap option that works and people have the option to add it or not (It all would'nt really add to the manufacturing time of the device since the user does it themselves). In class we talked about adding a strap instead of the glasses feature. A strap does seem like a better option such as a ski mask, this way a user's glasses can fit inside and it will be more comfortable for the user nto having the hwole device resting on their ears. I would also suggets a strap over the top of the head to distribute the weight better. It might be interesting to make it so that as with snowboarding goggles the user could attach the glasses to a helmet (only if wanted, obviously expensive if the user does nto own a helmet, but could be nice for demoing to a large group of people.) As Kelmmer suggested, if may be nice to create another size for children though that may not be necessary for your specific case).",222,1,1,1,

do make it a point to plan for at least one week ahead of time,15,1,1,0,
good but need to pivot due to taboo subject seems like you are doing productivity,15,1,1,1,
no dead ends but the navigation button in create task does not seem to work,15,1,0,0,
storyboards are too focused on the dialogue which draws away from the high level design,15,1,0,1,
some of these needs would not feasibly be attended to in the scope of design,15,1,0,0,
"Does the score ever go down? If not, you may not need the down button",15,1,0,1,
"For the yard scale, maybe his music should just play automatically to wake him up.",15,1,1,1,
How can user manipulate with the 2D screen_ Do they still use mouse and keyboards?,15,1,0,0,
"I like how the notes automatically organize themselves into headers , subheaders, and bullet points.",15,1,0,0,
I like how the yard interface allows users to compare their progress with other users.,15,1,0,0,
I like that it is organized by date but not that there are extraneous options.,15,1,0,0,
"I like the grid background, it gives a good sense of spacing for your content",15,1,0,1,
I think that the design is very clear but the keyword search is too big.,15,1,0,0,
I wish I can receive message/app notification for the ride update -- just like uber/lyft,15,1,1,0,
Is there a better way of accommodating gesture and voice control in the whole experience?,15,1,1,0,
"Overall, I like the idea! Maybe have price comparison between brands of the same item.",15,1,1,0,
price should also be shown in this pop up window. Case of recognition vs. recall.,15,1,1,1,
The feedback indicating the user is close to attaining their goal is helpful and intuitive,15,1,0,0,
"Upon an increase in score, a short animation or sound could add to the experience?",15,1,1,1,
You should a specific task for the persona to accomplish instead of introducing the interface.,15,1,1,0,
the first two activities dont clearly describe breakdowns it talks about needs without describing breakdowns first,16,1,0,1,
the main page is too textual think of a more visual representation to show positive interactions,16,1,1,0,
great fake login screen dont work on it anymore despite what any future rubrics might say,16,1,1,0,
try to be more clear who the target user is say by mentioning in a voiceover,16,1,1,0,
they appear to be a bit similar which could be fixed by better articulating the situations,16,1,1,0,
the select xxx component views state change is very subtle upon users clicking on each item,16,1,0,0,
game itself not functional but the start of the game as stated in the task is,16,1,0,0,
i only see the sell page with any functionality the other pages dont have any interaction,16,1,0,0,
although the underlying statistics are incorrect the conclusion was derived in a consistent line of reaonsing,16,1,0,0,
not much of a conclusion needs more discussion about what the results tell us and why,16,1,1,0,
pvalue not listed because you pvalue determines significance this should have been included in the calculation,16,1,1,1,
great job if not for the bug with the back button youd have gotten more points,16,1,0,1,
i wish there was a way for an investor to contact the scientist through the app,16,1,1,0,
too much focus on the solution you should not already have features in mind to implement,16,1,0,0,
your league pictures do not show the person in question which diminishes from examining the users,16,1,0,1,
clicking on get started on the landing page takes me to httpsthebearsturninherokuappcomgetstarted which doesnt do anything,16,1,0,0,
i would avoid using the tags test because that will be difficult to quantifiably measure accurately,16,1,1,1,
try to avoid listing similar needs you made up by coming up with a few more,16,1,1,0,
please provide a link next time ive check the repo corresponding to the app ie githubcomcse170swolewebapp,16,1,1,0,
avoid using quantitative scales for your interview questions because these will not garner you good insights,16,1,1,1,
ok pov but this is now taboo consider a multifaceted approach or a new topic altogether,16,1,1,1,
okay pov but i think the closet has more spotlight than the actual users of it,16,1,0,1,
notes provided but notes should be more detailed about the users entire process using the app,16,1,1,0,
storyboard 2 3 they state a problem and a solution where a prototype is not needed,16,1,0,0,
unmet but by considering the size of the team i bumped it up by one point,16,1,0,1,
some aspects of the interaction missing such as how to input budgets how to make goals,16,1,0,0,
please select pages carefully in this case pages for all subjects should have been marked thanks,16,1,1,1,
not possible to go back to the previous page please check out the video below httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7gnemqewmxc,16,1,1,0,
can still be polished in terms of layout and what possible options are possible when chatting,16,1,1,0,
a watch interface for reminders is an awesome way to stay on task and deliver notifications,16,1,0,0,
consider using force touch to rank the importance so it saves pixels and allows similar importance.,16,1,1,1,
"For inspiration, maybe you could think about how the receipt idea could be utilized for cooking?",16,1,1,0,
I like how comprehensive the choices are but I wish that language and region were automatic.,16,1,1,0,
I like how it pulls the professor's rating when you search for classes you might take.,16,1,0,0,
I like the color coordination! It's an easy way to identify the status of each application.,16,1,0,1,
I like the simplicity of your design. It does exactly what it should without anything unnecessary.,16,1,0,1,
I like the thumbs up thumbs down part as a way to filter for your interest.,16,1,0,0,
"I quite lile the visual design - good font choice (sans serif), minimalist, nice color scheme",16,1,0,1,
"I'm not sure about the red color, what kind of feeling are you trying to convey?",16,1,0,0,
"If possible, use pictures of food instead of words when showing orders in the yard interface.",16,1,1,0,
Is the calendar marked with anything? I might want to see my scheduled interviews marked there,16,1,1,0,
Is the inch scale really a good interace to show 360 degree renderings of a map?,16,1,1,0,
It is a really interesting topic and it is appealing to see puzzle pictures like this!,16,1,0,0,
It sounds interesting and very practical. but how does the lead user hack the existing problem?,16,1,0,0,
"It's a nice concept, but how does this relate to a super user and their innovations?",16,1,1,0,
"Not sure about what would happen excatuly after pressing the ""add"" button for the inch size.",16,1,0,0,
"On the bottom, your expiration/freq/category categories have unequal spacing and aren't centered. They have differing margins.",16,1,0,0,
"Overall, definitely, a very simple and yet powerful application. I can see myself using this !",16,1,0,0,
The daily digest and suggested options are a great way to relieve stress on the parent,16,1,0,0,
The house board could looks a bit neater and organized rather than a laundry list style.,16,1,1,0,
The visual design seems simplistic however there weren't enough interfaces for me to give effective feedback.,16,1,0,1,
try to be more explicit about how it relates to shaking up status quo otherwise good work,17,1,1,0,
adding a task only works partially and appears to be the most important part of the app,17,1,0,0,
try to phrase the needs for a typical user rather than specific people and not by name,17,1,1,0,
similar to the first prototype there are missing interactions how would you add a company for instance,17,1,0,1,
also please adapt it as a mobile web app if you plan to go ahead with this,17,1,1,0,
organizing tasks is too broadly phrased to give a good idea what the app assists in doing,17,1,0,1,
the first storyboard should have used a thicker instrument its just not the same with a pen,17,1,1,1,
its good to be comprehensive but i barely see what you might want to specifically test out,17,1,0,1,
details about the data collected are fuzzy if you can clarify im happy to restore this point,17,1,1,1,
online resources can be used to verify your results but the actual chisquare formula should be shown,17,1,1,0,
theres no expected value calculation for the noclick condition and therefore the derived chisquared value is incorrect,17,1,0,1,
you need to collect more facets of information on this screen to stay within the brief nontaboo,17,1,1,1,
the wireframe images are pretty blurry so its difficult to see a lot of the finer details,17,1,0,1,
a single screen is shown but even that wasnt completely explained otherwise the point wouldve been yours,17,1,0,1,
its alright to be a little messy sometimes but make sure that you communicate completely and concisely,17,1,1,0,
pov could probably be expanded on a bit more with why people arent motivated enough to exercise,17,1,1,0,
storyboard 3 needs to have a little more detail about how the user interacts with the app,17,1,1,0,
i do not see 15 needs some of the statements are should when they should be needs,17,1,1,0,
the bar to enter messages does not stay at the bottom after appending text gets cut off,17,1,1,0,
video feedback i liked your video great acting especially the huge satisfaction at the end thumbs up,17,1,0,0,
i like how the app allows you to chat with others in real time somethings to consider,17,1,0,0,
you are testing more than 1 thing by adding padding andor changing the 2 columns to 1,17,1,0,0,
the user needs more orientation than the video its still a little confusing but it looks good,17,1,1,0,
you havent included the names of the people on the team you whose prototype you were evaluating,17,1,1,0,
is it just a map with better recommendations are there other pages or tabs to navigate to,17,1,0,0,
the quests are in the same place in both urls am i looking in the wrong place,17,1,0,0,
some of these needs are more focused on the gym environment rather than user behavior of gymgoers,17,1,0,0,
Distance may be a better way to convey how close someone is to the next navigation change,17,1,1,0,
"foot - foot scale is nicely thought out, connects both the inch and yard scales in functionality.",17,1,0,1,
"I notice you have a settings button in the top corner, but I'm not sure it's needed",17,1,0,0,
I think that the sketches could be better used to communicate clearly the benfits of your idea.,17,1,1,0,
"Interface is simple in design - keeps essentials, not too cluttered (essentially a list of fridge elements)",17,1,1,0,
"Love the concept! However, is there a way of keeping track of the specific commands you've learned?",17,1,0,0,
Maybe intergrating third-party platforms such as google doc and help user to complete coursework within your app.,17,1,1,0,
Next time please talk through it so it's easier to understand what is going on . :),17,1,1,1,
Perhaps the car model and year could be a drop down to make it easy for users,17,1,1,1,
"Really like the yard interface, I think this would be something my brother would want to use!",17,1,0,0,
"The idea is super useful. However, one common fail with scheduling App is that require manual input.",17,1,0,0,
Why show the courses (greyed out) that are not available? Why not only shows those that are?,17,1,1,0,
take a more concrete stance this one gives a little insight but no direction to guide future decisions,18,1,1,1,
take a more insightful stance this one just cuts it as there is some direction to guide decisions,18,1,1,1,
how the app actually helps fulfill the need is ambiguous that should be addressed nicely explained situation though,18,1,1,0,
also there is no way a user can know where the person offering a ride is departing from,18,1,0,0,
try to keep details to a minimum storyboards are not meant to be elaborately illustrated good drawing though,18,1,1,1,
nicely done reduce the clutter a bit and this can be a great way to see remaining food,18,1,1,0,
this is too simplistic an idea to pursue for a long enough project as this well executed though,18,1,0,1,
apart from addingtrashing food items i dont see any other tasks possible the app should definitely do more,18,1,1,0,
if youd like me to reconsider any part of the grade let me know privately on piazza asap,18,1,1,0,
true kind of obvious but it seems like citizen science apps do fail at being fun and engaging,18,1,0,1,
your payment confirmation page has a dead link for get directions thats the only noticeable feature thats lacking,18,1,1,0,
how are they going to analyze each others data why is this science important what questions are there,18,1,1,0,
point of view should include some indication of why there is a problem or why the problem occurs,18,1,1,0,
although its polished than before i think theres still some potential to enhance the apps usability and interactivity,18,1,0,0,
try to be more specific about the typical user why will a middleaged freelancer use this for example,18,1,1,0,
the profile page doesnt open at times buttons to add a task do nothing not even dummy actions,18,1,1,0,
make sure that the summary page is better developed it seems crude as such but good work otherwise,18,1,1,0,
the user needs were redundant and the point of view provided a solution overall good job at needfinding,18,1,0,0,
who did what tasks this is very important especially for 4 member groups talk to me about this,18,1,1,0,
not detailed enough shows that you arent working on your app very much is that true or not,18,1,0,0,
datajson exists in github but it does not seem to be rendered anywhere chat messages are hard corded,18,1,0,0,
user needs need to target a general audience instead of jeff michael and sean use game players etc,18,1,1,0,
i wish the first screen was less cluttered i am not sure what information is on there either,18,1,1,0,
not enough changes other than those filling in gaps in the previously incomplete prototype or some are vague,18,1,0,0,
love the tree visualization remember what it was like a few weeks ago looking forward to your finale,18,1,0,0,
be sure to mention who does which task so i can see how work was delegated among teammates,18,1,1,1,
its basically there impressed so far you do have more work to do but the functionality is there,18,1,0,0,
can be somewhat confusing in terms of symbols being used actually but ok enough to receive the point,18,1,0,0,
what happens if the user made a mistake in creating a log item and wants to remove it,18,1,1,0,
b make sure to plan at least a week in advance i might have to dock points otherwise,18,1,1,1,
the 1st and 3rd storyboards a little too vague to be able to come up with prototype ideas,18,1,0,1,
"Consider to increase the contrast on the ""altitude""? The light green color might not be clear under sunlight",18,1,1,1,
"design is nice - minimalist, though some screens could use some restructuring to make use of excessive whitespace",18,1,1,1,
"Foot scale - minimalist, simple design is good, I like the icon style and general use of space",18,1,0,0,
"For the location, I think maybe the ""map view"" will be a good choice to visualize the data",18,1,1,0,
Great idea because sitting all day at an 8 to 5 can be very hard on our bodies.,18,1,0,1,
"I like how the user can personalize a lot of options, improving the emotional design of the app.",18,1,0,1,
I like that you can view the time slots and can RSVP for a certain washer or dryer!,18,1,0,0,
I like the circular interface for displaying the dealine. It is a great visual representation of time data.,18,1,0,1,
"I like the color scheme, I prefer dark colors so its not so bright, but maybe less neon.",18,1,1,1,
I like the inch scale use of space. I wish the foot scale can provide more historic information.,18,1,1,0,
"I like the watch design with boxes. However, the sliders seems to refined for such a small interface.",18,1,0,1,
I might want to see this on a hour interval schedule to visually see when I have gaps,18,1,1,1,
I really like the dance idea for unlocking but would prefer that for computer login instead of email.,18,1,1,0,
I really like the simplicity of the design. The landing screen looks really intuitive and esay to use.,18,1,0,1,
"I think ""May"" and ""2017"" should be in the same text field because they are not independently movable",18,1,1,1,
I would like to see the safety value for the hostels especially if it's a single female traveller.,18,1,1,1,
"I would recommend not having the transcript shown at all times, it should be able to be hidden",18,1,1,0,
I'm confused by the yard display - what is the bottom screen meant for me to do ?,18,1,0,0,
Im not nure if its controls are touch screen or a mouse to the screen where they play.,18,1,0,0,
It is better not place the number on top of the logo because it may affect the readablity.,18,1,1,1,
"Probably you can make the clickable buttons more visable. Such as adding some shadow around the box, etc",18,1,1,0,
Really like the watch interface - the speed number is huge - great design for a small screen,18,1,0,1,
The Add Message modules are a bit confusing . Too many choices a user needs to click on!,18,1,0,1,
This is not interesting and novel enough. You can add more functionalities and ways to interact with it.,18,1,1,1,
"We critiqued this in class and that's all I can come up with. Overall it's clean and informational,",18,1,0,0,
"What happens when you tap ""Start walking""? Will it show me a walking path to the lowest price?",18,1,0,0,
What would be the process for user to choose the applications that they want to actually apply for?,18,1,1,0,
"When the button turns green or red, the text should change to reflect the status such as ""calling""",18,1,1,0,
Why are there yellow and orange intermixed dates? I would expect them to be clumped together by color,18,1,1,0,
ps im happy to provide feedback about the prototype itself in case we didnt talk well enough in studio,19,0,0,0,
if youd genuinely like me to reconsider something i might have missed let me know privately on piazza asap,19,0,1,0,
good ideas but there could be many alternatives that already exist try to think how your offering is novel,19,1,1,1,
it seems like the firebase code is working for the account info but not necessarily for the projects aspect,19,1,1,0,
finally think about why users would participate to help in the first place what is the incentive for them,19,1,1,1,
think about how to align the idea with a need that is silently unfulfilled to make it more compelling,19,1,1,1,
be sure to write your name and pid on the top right corner of your assignment the next time,19,1,1,0,
try to be more clear who the target user is say a particular type of student you often observe,19,1,1,0,
the captions clearly explain the tools that the subjects used but it doesnt mention the breakdowns that they faced,19,1,0,1,
it is unclear how to add a teammate or the specific instructions for what to do on the mission,19,1,0,0,
is there no confirmation for the items ive collected whats the connection between this game and the real world,19,1,1,0,
also think about what gets lost once we digitally transfer the overall experience of exchanging contact information or resumes,19,1,1,0,
there should be pictures for every subject but ill give you the point since it was not specified explicitly,19,1,1,1,
1 point of extra credit awarded for efforts in getting your gameplay to work good job with using d3,19,1,0,1,
would there be a way to further extrapolate this statement and connecting it to peoples internal triggers ie feelings,19,1,1,0,
confusing names in cloud watched vs done watched buttons but more importantly i couldnt find which one does what,19,1,0,1,
the account page is isolated cant go back to it also i cant scroll on the create recipe page,19,1,1,0,
i dont really see how this is connected to the specific pov point given for connecting with a storyboard,19,1,0,0,
i liked how you went into detail about the breakdowns of each person you observed great job at needfinding,19,1,0,0,
the button styling does not appear to be consistent if you end up using the red add task button,19,1,1,0,
i need to see your code on github also please disable the login functionality completely it is entirely unnecessary,19,1,1,1,
your second sentence is a bit too descriptive in that you tell the user to click a specific icon,19,1,0,1,
i like the importance rating system instead of stars i would maybe opt for colors red severe green casual,19,1,1,0,
the view ingredients button on all meal components seem unnecessary in most of the cases ingredients are all viewable,19,1,1,1,
please do not provide external links as far as possible and do not modify them its tedious to check,19,1,1,1,
i do not know what you are using as json or do you have a database please specifiy this,19,1,1,1,
good this is less taboo due to multifaceted point of view still try to move more toward unexplored domains,19,1,1,1,
some of the functionality is unclear what else can the app do besides have the user input dog info,19,1,1,1,
Also maybe adding some feedback system from the crowd? Like a upvote/downvote feature to get some feedback from audience?,19,1,1,1,
Good use of broad domains as well as some that are a little more specific to find lead users.,19,1,0,1,
How does the controller tie into the yard scale interface? What separates the yard control from the foot control?,19,1,1,1,
I like how it predicts your actions and suggests in real time what commands the user should use instead.,19,1,0,0,
I like that your hack only has one page and it's color coded but it is not very organized.,19,1,0,0,
"I like the visual design and layout, I think you really hit on the feedback you got last class",19,1,0,0,
"I think there are too many colors, you could take away the red and the interface would do fine",19,1,1,0,
I wish the empty spaces were completely used. Make the interface full screen instead of half of the screen.,19,1,1,0,
"I'm a little confused, are the 2 different interfaces or they are just one but very smart interface ?",19,1,0,1,
"Not sure what the rectangles on the side are supposed to represent, maybe this space could be used better",19,1,1,0,
Overall the design is very clean and I think it will be useful to people who want to donate!,19,1,0,0,
The red on dark blue is a little jarring. Have you tried to experiment with different hues of red?,19,1,1,1,
This is very cool! How long will the arrows stay on the screen? What if it blocks something importan?,19,1,0,1,
"Very interesting concept! I really like it, but I feel like you could flesh it out a bit more!",19,1,1,0,
What is the difference between the foot and the yard scales? They seem to both fulfill the same purpose,19,1,0,1,
Who is the emergency contact? I think the name should be displayed so you know exactly who you're calling,19,1,1,1,
"You identify a problem that common users have, but I'm not sure your solution is for a lead user.",19,1,0,0,
i dont see where youve described a specific instance where there is friction in the collaborative process in this report,20,1,0,0,
another improvement in presentation would be to show actual classes and topics instead of placeholders and explain the structure separately,20,1,1,1,
as discussed making a chrome extension is unchartered territory for this course which comes with its own set of risks,20,1,0,1,
not seeing you use json data anywhere if you are post on piazza to get point back point added 12112016,20,1,1,0,
its good that youve justified how heuristics will be adhered to but something also worth mentioning is the actual criticism,20,1,1,0,
i can see the value of the current textual list interface but some interesting visualization to attract users wouldnt hurt,20,1,1,1,
you might want to conduct comparative analysis on existing apps while focusing on how your app is distinctive from others,20,1,1,1,
important interface elements are potentially ignored here such as reordering activities if that makes sense and links to auxiliary pagesfunctionality,20,1,1,1,
the pictures that are still broken and some of the functionaly that does not work can be interpreted as error,20,1,0,0,?
storyboards should state an issue and also introduce an interface the storyboards should show how that interface solved the issue,20,1,1,0,
think about how to align the idea with a need that is unfulfilled because people remain in their comfort zones,20,1,1,1,
its difficult to draw a conclusion from the analysis because of the use of noncategorical data in the chisquared test,20,,,,
great job finishing the interaction flow rewarded one extra point for implementing the search function adding comments and upvote downvote,20,,,,
extra point for database integration at this early stage try to focus on deep interactions rather than simply technical details,20,,,,
they are very very similar ill give you the point though since the app itself is differing with each storyboard,20,,,,
the core problem the pov conveys is vague and is weakly connected to the specifics found from the need statements,20,,,,
user needs must be expressed in a selfexplanatory manner for example 7 is vague without the context known from observations,20,,,,
points given for going above and beyond with using a database and styling the app smooth animations and not buggy,20,,,,
2how long does the user have to wait for a response is the app really helpful if no one responds,20,,,,
be careful about distribution of work make sure to input any potential schedule conflicts ie midterms out of town etc,20,,,,
you dont have to mention the names of the specific people when writing about user needs they are generic statements,20,,,,
i noticed you have a lot of html pages i wonder if rendering your json through handlebars might be easier,20,,,,
this is a bit oversimplified work with users to see what they would expect to do for such an app,20,,,,
storyboard 1 if someone were to pick up this storyboard they would not know how to create a distinct prototype,20,,,,
try having greater focus on violations it appears you tried to balance the two which is okay but not expectednecessary,20,,,,
after getting navigated to the mbti test page theres no control to go back check out the video below httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv6nisr7snkm,20,,,,
also try to ensure it works online maybe try a private video on youtube its likely a file format issue,20,,,,
its not working well but ill go easy on you guys you have a hard technical challenge in this design,20,,,,
"I like how the app provides cool sight seeing spots on the users route, this heightens the overall travel experience",20,,,,
I like the different modules that a person can add or delete based on the type of trip they're planning.,20,,,,
I question how often people search while taking notes? I get it if its after they're done and reviewing notes.,20,,,,
I really like these icons. But these icons might be too small to easily see on a watch size display.,20,,,,
"I think this is a pretty good idea, there are lots of people who have trouble keeping track job apps.",20,,,,
"I wish the weather display is bigger, and maybe add a line chart for visualizing the data might be useful.",20,,,,
I would like to see a typographic difference between the recruiter name and position. Maybe use bold for the name?,20,,,,
"If your persona already knows people in the class, couldn't he just catch up on material outside of class time?",20,,,,
interface is well-thought out - lots of edge cases seem to be addressed / UI flow is smooth and uniform,20,,,,
It is interesting and helpful to use artificial intelligence to recognize the picture the users upload and auto-fill the form.,20,,,,
It looks really cool. I wish there is a video showing what's going on and how you interact with it,20,,,,
"Really like the auto-set alarm feature, but I wish I have freedom to turn off auto-set alarm on certain event",20,,,,
Text should be white or show high contrast if it's a clickable button! Faded text indicates that it is disabled,20,,,,
Theres been a lot of progress on the design. I think that the simplicity and interactions are better flushed out.,20,,,,
Very nice use of AR! I feel like there's a lot of possibilities here that you could explore more in-depth.,20,,,,
What exactly are these balls for? I'm a bit confused as to how they contribute to the overall interface here.,20,,,,
please see feedback on the dev plan from the previous assignment and no need to include the plan for past weeks,21,0,1,0,
while your submission has points about the major problems with both the prototypes it lacks meaningful thoughts about the heuristic evaluations,21,1,0,0,
visual elements such as headers look inconsistent profile page input fields dont have outlines or is it just on my machine,21,1,0,0,
the storyboards are fine but you can do quite a bit with google maps think about how you can be different,21,,,,
although its polished than before i think theres still a fair amount of room to enhance the apps usability and interactivity,21,,,,
because these students are your potential users perhaps make your application more positive or add a component that reigns in positivity,21,,,,
one good way to get more usable feedback is by observing users try out the app and noting hiccups they face,21,,,,
a few of your user needs are a bit repetitive i would encourage you to delve deeper into the user needs,21,,,,
as a suggestion the photos would look better if shown from a 90 degree angle to the plane of the paper,21,,,,
im concerned about your first 2 ideas they dont really offer a unique solution i like the 3rd one the best,21,,,,
pov doesnt describe the reasons why users have difficulty being motivated in exercising a pov statement should not contain solution statements,21,,,,
you might want to conduct some comparative analysis on other matchmaking or dating platforms and see how yours can stand out,21,,,,
would liked to have seen a more explicit mention of how the topic might be influenced by games with a purpose,21,,,,
many needs are similar or already have solutions which your subjects arent using it might be useful to find out why,21,,,,
i agree that having visualization could help people motivate but without stating why this pov fails to focus on user needs,21,,,,
borderline taboo good pov though focus more on procrastination as a psychologicalemotional issue than a productivity issue and youll be good,21,,,,
if you go to httpscse170projectherokuappcomcustomerordersummary and then hit the back button it fails to load the resources from the json file,21,,,,
good work here you could try matching any word rather than just the beginning to further improve the user experience user,21,,,,
i wish there was a voice over or captions to explain what exactly was happening because the background noises were distracting,21,,,,
plz remove login credential requirement there could be more functionality its not really clear what hearts mean when displaying mood data,21,,,,
not there yet youre not working much with the data focus more on quantitative data or quantify your qualitative data somehow,21,,,,
hard to see prototype well in pictures its unclear if the user plays these mini games while actually cooking or not,21,,,,
focus less on the login page and user set up and more on the actual navigation and interactions within the app,21,,,,
when the add amount modal view is up there is no way to dismiss it check out the video below httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtcerzufjr7m,21,,,,
Directions could be overlayed on the map to give a more specific spatial mapping of what to do and conserve space,21,,,,
"For a mobile interface, the buttons seem a bit hard to press, especially for people with larger fingers (like me, LOL).",21,,,,
"For the visual design, the background on the right is a little dark. Probably use a lighter gray would be better",21,,,,
Great feature! But I am not sure whether the user will remember to use this feature in a really intense moment?,21,,,,
I like how not cluttered this inteface is but I wonder if you can put anything on the space on top.,21,,,,
"I like how you have incorporated different colors for the different modes, which makes it easy to distinguish one from another.",21,,,,
I like that there are prereqs but I wish that there were more information about the classes such as the professor.,21,,,,
I think it is useful to sort by expiration and quantity and but I wish that there was higher information density.,21,,,,
I think your name and expiration date boxes need to be larger. There is no reason why they are so small?,21,,,,
I wish the outline section on the right could be truncated to just show title (that user can expand if needed),21,,,,
I wish you can show more edge cases and come up with a realistic and super concise example in the video.,21,,,,
I would want to choose how long to wait and see how much it would cost for different durations of time,21,,,,
I would want to see the times of all the events I've favorited here and the corresponding locations on the map.,21,,,,
"I'm confused about the ""I'm a passenger"" button and the 2 next to it. What happens when you click on it?",21,,,,
"If the user can disable force shut down, then can't they play the game all night and never go to bed?",21,,,,
"If this is an app, I believe it is better to automatically scan the environment when the users open the app.",21,,,,
It looks like it would be useful for an video game artist. Color might be nice to have in future prototypes!,21,,,,
It would be nice to link to the recruiters linkedin page or portfolio so you can get more information on them,21,,,,
"It's pretty simple, but overall I feel like with a bit more fleshing out it could yield some very interesting results.",21,,,,
"It's unclear what the ""Approximate time"" means. Maybe it should be ""Approximate time until normal pricing"" or something of that sort",21,,,,
Looks like a very functional layout and I like how specific it is for solving the task of planning a hackothon.,21,,,,
"Overall the design makes sense, except for the user picture. I don't see how it's related to getting an item made",21,,,,
The content on the first screens is a little unclear of what it means and how exactly to interact with it.,21,,,,
"Varying text sizes could be used to emphasize the importance of certain info (ex: ""Interviewer"" could be smaller than ""Thomas Johnson"")",21,,,,
make sure that these are incorporated in the development plan also note the rubric for a8 especially to fix any aesthetic details,22,1,1,0,
if im missing something that you think is definitely worthy of consideration feel free to let me know in the last studio,22,0,0,0,
this just shows the situation and hints at a need a good storyboard covers all the three ses situation sequence and satisfaction,22,,,,
how does one create different types of workouts a lot else can possibly be thought of in terms of interactions and features,22,,,,
pictures relate well with your observations but try to make them understandable independently the words made up for the captions this time,22,,,,
focus on what the interaction achieves for the user rather than the tasks that they are able to do on the app,22,,,,
try not to mention all relatedsimilar interactions but to get to the most important ones so that your point is communicated well,22,,,,
it will be hard to determine which is more effective so just stick with one change such as the text being different,22,,,,
i like how patients can search for articles and scientists easily is there a way for them to savebookmark articles they liked,22,,,,
you did mention a possible outcome but all outcomes should be taken into account ie both a null and experimental hypothesis result,22,,,,
2 extra credit point for going above and styling the pages and having smooth interactions that are not buggy and fullyfleshed out,22,,,,
too much focus on the solution you already have ideas of features you want to implement which will limit your design space,22,,,,
i had a group do something very similar last year so the idea be careful of turning this into another timer app,22,,,,
interesting but how do you differentiate this from other trivia apps or how can you make this more than a trivia app,22,,,,
remember to specify who will be taking care of which task even if you will both be working on the same task,22,,,,
good job at needfinding your observations could have dug deeper into the breakdowns that the subjects encountered while they were note taking,22,,,,
very sparse and too directly guiding the user plan to ask more questions and gather more input on the brief and debrief,22,,,,
"For security, in the all-in-one view, maybe it can just show a feed directly, and then allow quick toggle through each feed.",22,,,,
However I am still confused with the recipes thing because I don't really know what functions the app can serve me here,22,,,,
I believe the camera button should be more obvious. You can put it on the top since it is an important feature.,22,,,,
I don't really know how can you rotate the Yard size display since it is supposed to be on a public display,22,,,,
"I like the visual design, it is simple and since it is specifically made to be cheap, cardboard is the logical approach.",22,,,,
I like your idea of organizing Application for different companies so as to help people not to miss the company application deadline,22,,,,
I think quantity is important because having a lot of vegetables is more of a problem than having a few vegetables left.,22,,,,
I wish the pictures had text labels for clarity. I like how the days and colors show the urgency of food expiration.,22,,,,
I'm not sure how useful temperature is? I really like the seeing pictures of what the inside of the room is though.,22,,,,
"If I want to replace the lightbulb, I'd also want to know where to get one and what is a reasonable price.",22,,,,
Inch: I like the relevant info that is easily viewable. The text seems a bit small though for such a small screen.,22,,,,
It would be nice to see travel time totals instead or in addition to how much longer each choice will take you,22,,,,
providing a diet via an apple watch may be difficult. Its hard to fit much text on the screen and stay readable,22,,,,
Some function seems counter intuitive like listening through microphone for surrounding dangers but putting on earphones might hinder ability to recognize danger.,22,,,,
"Some screens on the watch view is good. Like the weather. Others seems to be displaying too much, like the clock toggles.",22,,,,
The floor buttons would be hard to click on a watch screen. Maybe just have one button/interface to reserve any open room?,22,,,,
"The user case could be confusing, The added flow chart looks good though, It helps clear up possible confusion of the scenario.",22,,,,
This is extemerly specifc. Well Done ! I'm looking at the interface and i'm able to understand the function of this product.,22,,,,
good job its an interesting app with fine design hope youve had some fun this quarter in studio ps consider taking cogs 121,23,0,0,0,
unfortunately i dont get what this app is about and it seems too similar to the previous prototype lets talk about this sometime,23,,,,
while the description is good i need your perspective on how the activity falls under the umbrella of shaking up the status quo,23,,,,
observations are quite good but there should have been emphasis on analyzing if things are going well or if not the issues faced,23,,,,
creative idea i have not seen any applications like this i think it builds a necessary bridge between researchers and students and patients,23,,,,
ok but reframe it so that it addresses the need for potential citizen scientists to be able to actually find citizen science platforms,23,,,,
some of these needs not explicitly from the breakdowns and observations mentioned but point awarded because you hit most of the points well,23,,,,
good work with the timers the interaction works well hence an extra point make sure to use json data in your app though,23,,,,
i wish i was able to clearly see the features of the interface the angle of the video made it hard to see,23,,,,
explanation of outcome of ab testing could be more in depth maybe explain what your null hypothesis is and significant differenceno significant difference,23,,,,
photos focused too much on the interface of the sites rather than showing the users reaction or showing the user within these interactions,23,,,,
sketches are not what we expected but interesting nonetheless and just crossed the threshold for a correct for the purposes of the rubric,23,,,,
interesting idea be careful of thinking of potential gametypes as those are more solutions and right now were just focusing on the needs,23,,,,
no github link provided in assignment submission but i pulled it from previous assignments remember to include a link to your github repo,23,,,,
because of the diversity of your observation in different activities i think your need proposal is very interesting and full of design opportunities,23,,,,
the home button is somewhat redundant why not have the app name at the top serve as the link as is usually expected,23,,,,
there were a few pages that did not seem to show a separate page modalnamely the password and register in the login page,23,,,,
im not sure how storyboard 2 and 3 relates to pov as there seems to be no component regarding the users personality representation,23,,,,
i think the topic you chose is very interesting and unique but the aspect of using mobile games doesnt seem to be related,23,,,,
"Always make your field big if its something the user will click. In the last picture, they're very small and easy to miss.",23,,,,
Building a order using public wall size display might not be a best choice - a personalized tablet will compelet this really well.,23,,,,
"cancel is a secondary action. it should have less visual weight than ""on my way!"" We don't want users to click on it!",23,,,,
Great simple layout and dsign. You show all of the important things that need to be present in an easy to interpret layout.,23,,,,
I like how i can add artwork to my collections. i wish there is more interaction with another user for the yard display.,23,,,,
"I like the minimal interface, I don't think the user needs to see a ton of information so keeping it simple is ideal.",23,,,,
I think the interface is really well orgnaized and does not include many of the confusing features that so many text editors include.,23,,,,
I think your function does explains itself and the scenario is valid and good. But is it safe to check watch when snowboarding???,23,,,,
I wish the map on the yard screen is more visible. I like how the inch display can guide me to specific artwork.,23,,,,
"I'm a little confused, is it a 2 way call? Or just a recording of the audio, which the emergency contact can hear?",23,,,,
"I'm not sure, but it looks like location is entered rather than detected which would be hard to do on a smart watch.",23,,,,
"Initially, it's unclear to me what the ""check"" button means. What is the user checking? You can be more specific in your labels.",23,,,,
It is better to consider the problem that the white words are diffcult to read with grey background for the foot scale interface.,23,,,,
Not sure how often rooms are actually available on an immediate basis. But I guess for the design we can assume they are??,23,,,,
Would like to see the real prototype using digital design. Some online real time assistant or option of uploading pictures would be better,23,,,,
satisfaction is muddled up as the need is to not get distracted but the character is shown happy when he gets to browse fb,24,,,,
your descriptions are very short and vague they need to be detailed i dont see any sort of clear engagement with the user either,24,,,,
it might be useful to emphasize through the test the importance of collaborating with your garden members to maintain the quality of your garden,24,,,,
point of view should be a single concise statement that captures the needs of all users rather than explaining the need for each user,24,,,,
there is no description of unique interactions in addition these interactions are not unique to this app and are found in most budgeting apps,24,,,,
there is scope to have the activity log do more than merely show the history ie how would users want to learn from it,24,,,,
overall some interesting ideas for a unique topic it will be interesting to see how you explore translating this digital game with the realworld,24,,,,
i recommend you only change one of the options to checkboxes rather than the whole page it will be easier to test this way,24,,,,
saving a workout takes you back to the home page which is unexpected also editing inputs with a keyboard is not the best idea,24,,,,
the check boxes could have side effects such as moving those suggestions down or highlighting them differently to make it more apparent to users,24,,,,
feel free to use a plan that actually works for you this is not for us but to help your group work things out,24,,,,
"actually, maybe your system can be starter and it can automatically choose the correct mode for certain environment. You can set it as default.",24,,,,
Hey there ! Great work. I have trouble opening the LFG tool. I'm not sure if this is on my part or the critiquekit.,24,,,,
I like how the interface takes the trouble of subdividing body areas out of the user's hands and guides them towards finding more workouts,24,,,,
"I like the interface design for the interface. I wish I can ""bookmark""/""save"" some common settings for the lighting to get some quick access.",24,,,,
I pretty much like your idea. But the interface for multiple windows does not quite look good. Why are those screens tweaked like that?,24,,,,
"I think if you're including seat # information, your persona would appreciate seats taken, and a visual representation of where there are available seats.",24,,,,
"I think that you did great needfinding but I wish I could see more design in your prototype, like what's holding the tablet up.",24,,,,
I'm confused as to how this is a lead user solution. Does evreyone face this issue and how does your user hack the problem?,24,,,,
"In the foot face. I think there should be a price shown under the Recommended Products, rather than after I click on the ""compare"".",24,,,,
"Inch scale - buttons, elements, and text are all far too small. Consider reducing the task able to be completed on the inch scale.",24,,,,
Initially it's hard to break into because it's a lot going on. I think that the type of noises are good in different colors.,24,,,,
"It would be nice, if this text didnt protrude into the chart section and was onlu restricted to left of the thick grey line",24,,,,
"Probabaly you can add more information about the event that relative to transportation, for example, the location of the event, the distance and etc.",24,,,,
The task seems quite vague - come up with a concrete scenario in which the UI is driven by the lead user's specific need,24,,,,
This looks really good! I'm not certain how useful the I'm feeling lucky feature is and I don't think people care about past reservations.,24,,,,
Unable to access the PDF -- I've tried contacting the user and getting permission to access the file. Will update once I get access.,24,,,,
"When someone is new to football game, it is better to clear the meaning of numbers for the yard scale interface on the top.",24,,,,
YARD SCALE 1) I like how the app displays deals based on the user's life. This adds a sense of personalization to the app.,24,,,,
what about when the user clicks outside the input field and then clicks back make sure not to count erroneously and use the appropriate test,25,1,1,0,
some unique features stated seemed to be visible but not implemented such as allowing users to sign nda disclosure scientist receiving funds and filtering projects,25,,,,
you ought to have included more of the calculations as shown in the slides rather than just a line of calculation which i cant understand,25,,,,
calendar page is secondary functionality pick more data visualizations to wizard of oz but implement the capacity to collect the data that would drive them,25,,,,
there should be one single point of view that captures the needs for all your users rather than a point of view for each person,25,,,,
point of view should be a concise statement that captures a single reason for all users point awarded because i think you caught the sentiment,25,,,,
when i complete a task and then refresh the page the tasks i completed reappear and the number of tasks left to complete never changes,25,,,,
the instructions should better emphasize the personal food and mood tracking aspect the instructions still make it seem like the pet is of more importance,25,,,,
would inputting a specific mbti type will terminally remove all other people of incompatible types what if users still would like to see other people,25,,,,
your app works perfectly well with no errors and also has some nice interactions youd have gotten more extracredit points had you implemented more interactions,25,,,,
interesting pov focused on the logging data inputting aspect of your daily diet and activity i look forward to seeing how the project would evolve,25,,,,
some of the needs are very similar it would have been interesting to consider different types of job seekers to get varied and distinct needs,25,,,,
not sure if your latest changes were pushed because much of the functionality you mentioned completing in your development plan was not in the app,25,,,,
point awarded but the tasks should be centered around the different assignments weektoweek so you can ensure that you meet all rubric and assignment requirements,25,,,,
it isnt clear for which of your users you have written notes for you need to write a separate set of notes for each one,25,,,,
the changes are more appropriately filling in gaps in the previously incomplete prototype that is not the intent as heuristic violations are not being rectified,25,,,,
oh i see the map now make it more easily accessible im hesitant to give this point because it still feels like its missing something,25,,,,
your app is beautifully designed and the core functionality appears to be implemented for the most part moreover the interaction appears to be almost seamless,25,,,,
"Custom modifications to mechanical keyboards beyond keycap replacement certainly fall under the domain of ""lead users"", I'm curious to see how your design turns out.",25,,,,
"Generally, I think of clicking as trying to see more details not add. You may want a separate ""+"" button for adding to your schedule",25,,,,
Hmm. While this makes sense...I think the text is getting lighter too quickly. If anything I think maybe making the size smaller makes more sense.,25,,,,
How does a percentage tell the user how their posture is suffering? Seems to not be a very direct or even accurate measure of posture,25,,,,
"I didn't think the dot, dash, and box intuitively represents stressful activities, comments, and relaxing activities. Maybe you could look at icons that fit better?",25,,,,
"I don't quite like your font type. And although the digit is large enough to say, I can barely see the little text underneath it.",25,,,,
I like how different keys on the keyboard contain different types of switches - allowing for alternative types of feedback based on the key hit.,25,,,,
I like how it shows the price per time. I also really like how it shows the different parking spots and how far it is.,25,,,,
I like how useful this design is to your user but I wish that there were more functionality shown in the prototype with the screens.,25,,,,
I like the simiplicity and organization of the app. I wish there was more space for the key topic and less for the other resources.,25,,,,
I like your idea of demoing human body in the public display that makes it clear to see which part of body is going well,25,,,,
"I like your scenario. I thought you decided no longer doing the Tijuana thing though, nice to see you coming back to your original design",25,,,,
I really like your idea. Maybe there is a way to add in a better gauge of if the user is hitting the marks correctly.,25,,,,
I think that the foot scale could be better explained in your persona. Would it be used only before? or during the massage as well?,25,,,,
"INCH SCALE 1) Instead of having text on the 2nd screen, maybe you could use voice output to guide the user throughout his shopping route.",25,,,,
"It would be nice to know the model and color of the car, kind of like Uber. So you know which is the right car",25,,,,
Overall I really like the idea. Consider that ther could be a bigger difference between the yard and inch functionality. Be creative on the yard!,25,,,,
Really like the design! I wish the app can have a tracking feature showing a visualization of my time distribution and my progress on sleeping.,25,,,,
"Try changing the buttons on the yard scale. I think they mock real life too much, but will be hard to control in that way.",25,,,,
not a real interpretation you need to provide an explanation as to why the test turned out the way it did even if it isnt correct,26,1,1,0,
a prototype is complete in itself it is not any particular page as a result i have to dock points for the second prototype entirely unfortunately,26,0,0,1,
appears to be incomplete try to see how you could help the persona with an app if possible and indicate the result that makes her happy,26,,,,
take a more insightful stance this one just cuts it as there is some direction to guide decisions also storyboards dont focus on the motivation part,26,,,,
the rubric mentions describing a core problem without offering a solution your pov has a set of possible solutions reviews of dining hall food splitting receipts,26,,,,
its unclear whether i have done the task correctly is this just adding a task also is there a way to assign tasks to specific people,26,,,,
i wish the pov contained a little more context as to what it is about keeping the memories that is currently missing from the observed users,26,,,,
your user needs are a bit too specific it would help to generalize the need a slight bit so that you may address a bigger audience,26,,,,
great job finishing most of the features rewarded two point for implementing the tag filtering feature as well as the time measurement and animation in checkpoints,26,,,,
the interactions that you mention are not implemented how would you facilitate communication a chat system how would you handle money logistics including a base price,26,,,,
it would have been great if the pov contained some explanation as to what specifically is the implication of having different attitudes towards using these apps,26,,,,
because you are using an outside library please put in comments with keywords like json so that i can see where your data io functionality is,26,,,,
after checking your development plan i decided not to award your team the point because there were no changes or additional tasks in the new version,26,,,,
i wish there was some way for the app to know where i am how did the app know that gobind needed a seat in geisel,26,,,,
i like the side navigation i suggest researching if the order should be changed perhaps by importance is chatting more important than chores in your app,26,,,,
analyzing other existing banking apps might provide some insights to latent design opportunities but i think graphically associating spending with some memory is an interesting idea,26,,,,
navigation feels tedious due to the hamburger menu since these arent pages one would go to infrequently and instead seem to be important to the app,26,,,,
Adding a social feature to the spp such as leaderboard might also be useful. Peer pressure and gamification can improve motivation of keep using the app.,26,,,,
How come the tablet would know user's current posture? It might be better to be tutorial site that teaches how to relax body (like yoga instructions..),26,,,,
I dont belive the sound output from a watch would be sufficient to notify surrounding people. Emitting it from a different source would be more effective,26,,,,
I like the map function and seeing all the attractions and different hostels at once. I would imagine it might be difficult once outliers are introduced.,26,,,,
I like the organization and I wonder if there is anything skeumorphic that you can do with this interface where you have more icons of food.,26,,,,
I think it is hard to put four buttons in the same screen on smart watch and users may eaily press the wrong button by mistake.,26,,,,
I think there is a lot of potential for needs here. Let's think about what kind of need that lead users of this product could use,26,,,,
"I wish I can receive voice feedback for the popup issues -- in some cases, user might not be able to directly look at the display",26,,,,
"I wish there are more ways to interact with the screen. And as said in class, the seating area colors needs to be decided more carefully.",26,,,,
I wish you can put the introduction of the app in the login page and you do not need the about button at the top bar.,26,,,,
"If comments, likes, etc. are important to this user then your design would possibly make these features clear visually appealing to the user reading the article.",26,,,,
It would be fun to also include some different sort methods such as by 'items rarely used' since your lead user expressed concerns about forgetting items.,26,,,,
Really like this task control interface - consider to add more contrast to the icon? Read on grey might not be clear enough on certain backgrounds?,26,,,,
"Since all the player is doing is adding or subtracting numbers to their score, perhaps using a different functionality would be more intuitive (e.g., slide right/left).",26,,,,
"This idea is pretty cool - I've seen it implemented in games such as Fallout 4, which contain extensive lists of items across many different categories.",26,,,,
Very handy! Maybe you could design an app that scans in the receipt and makes a list of items bought and displays it on the fridge?,26,,,,
Yard: I like that it takes into account the person's profile since that's definitely a struggle with finding guests if there are many of them waiting.,26,,,,
apart from the main idea in the storyboard to make sense of job emails there is a lot that can be done to make a complete app,27,1,0,0,
i am unable to create a project view my created projects moreover the projects articles in the home page do not appear to link to separate pages,27,,,,
please make sure to select the right pages from the pdf that correspond to the question i have fixed it to show what we would usually expect,27,,,,
ps looking at your live page it seems that you intended to offer activity choices solid bullet points are not a clear lowfi representation of radio buttons,27,,,,
the profile page says training topic so im confused as to what the exact purpose of this page is does this fit under the training tab instead,27,,,,
i wish the login pagesplash page had a statement that explains the goal of your app healthnet can be about anything for example linkedin connect to opportunity,27,,,,
i think your idea fits the theme well and i think you did a good job taking note of the breakdowns and successes that your interviewees encountered,27,,,,
the app is functional with no dead ends and it has clearcut features the app seems simple enough to learn and use which is a great thing,27,,,,
the needs should be based on the user not the system ill give you the point but you should be thinking from more from the user perspective,27,,,,
a list format for these changes would not only make it easier to read but would provide you with an overview of how to prioritize these changes,27,,,,
i can see what you wrote came from your observations but they are not really needs ill still give you the point since it is close enough,27,,,,
points 345 are the same but in a differing context all of them are i wish i could get reviews of x by people whove used x,27,,,,
i believe user profile view isnt completely functional the redo task button or clicking the add button on the homepage doesnt change anything on the profile page,27,,,,
Add the location information in the inch interface because watch will vibrate when user gets close to certain dining hall. The location info matters at this time.,27,,,,
And I am not sure what Lead User's creative part is. It looks like sending message is a thing that most people would do in that situtation.,27,,,,
"Being about to find area without surge can definitely be a good idea. However, the idea need to employ more design thinking to make it more helpful.",27,,,,
Foot: I like that you can see the relevant info right away (number and time remaining)! It's great that you can see the menu as you're waiting.,27,,,,
"For the transcript section, I would like to automatically have dates and 'important information' highlighted and possibly moved to a new location within the note taking app.",27,,,,
Great job in providing a digest of the tasks for the next day. This does a good job of putting ones schedule in context of their todo's,27,,,,
How does it calculate what time to sleep based on previous patterns? If you've slept few hours does it try to compensate by having you sleep more?,27,,,,
"I like the design in the shoe, it is very creative. I think that the skethes could be a little more clear in order to show more.",27,,,,
I like the functionality because I find it hard to take notes. I wish that it could drag snippets from the links into under the key topic.,27,,,,
I really like the idea - in what way are the grocery lists synchronized with the app? via receipt or some sort of other itemized store list?,27,,,,
I wish you can put the search bar and the overview on top of the side bar since they are the most frequently elements to look at.,27,,,,
I wonder if a map would be hard to read. Maybe it would be better to display zones/aisles? or just the instructions of Go Forward 3 minutes.,27,,,,
If your intention is to reserve a room I don't see the option to do that here. Unless this is time remaining on the room you have?,27,,,,
"Inch interface is too much for an iWatch interface. I recommend giving it one function only, or putting these features into a widget instead of an iwatch.",27,,,,
"Love your idea !! It would be nice to see some interface on the board. For example: maybe put some settings on their, snapshot, things like that.",27,,,,
Probably make use of the haptic feedback and that can be a huge user experience improvement and reduce the problem of looking at the watch while snowboarding,27,,,,
"Visually the design is very clean but I do think it is hard to read the orange font on a white background, especially at a far distance",27,,,,
1 point penalty for late submission it was after 2 am i can consider the 107 am submission to be on time but looks like it wasnt complete,28,0,0,1,
good job in filling the functionality gap over the past few weeks but i think theres still some potential to improve the aesthetics and interaction of the app,28,,,,
it might be useful to have interview questions at the end of your test so you can gather good insights about what your user thought about your app,28,,,,
the idea of visualizing the progress of saving money is novel there might be a way to make it more distinctive and thus letting your app stand out,28,,,,
it didnt seem like there was a clear solution at the end of the storyboard because the user was still ignoring the timer again avoid making a timer,28,,,,
there are tad bits that can be enhanced for example there is a downward arrow in the my tasks page which is hard to know the functionality of,28,,,,
conveying emotions in artifacts photos videos text is a very interesting design space good job but the link between your observation to the need statements is somewhat weak,28,,,,
the design of the activity is interesting but its exploration connected to the pov is limited what other pain points scenarios do people have in managing their finances,28,,,,
because your app assumes the existence of two smart watches i think it would have been great if you could include interaction through them as well while testing,28,,,,
lots of confusion and misunderstanding observed from the users its a good time to think about how the app is structured around user scenarios and redesign if necessary,28,,,,
"FOOT SCALE 1) You should include an ""Other"" tab on the top because every grocery store sells different items. This tab could cover snacks, alcohol, baked goods, etc..",28,,,,
Foot: I like the status bar but I think it is somewhat visually unappealing and you may want to change it to a color gradient across the bar.,28,,,,
I like the idea of a visual overlay for instruction - its quite similar to the production effects that a sports network would do during a replay analysis,28,,,,
I like the interface but why doesn't the video mode go to full screen and what is the purpose of the grey background taking up so much space?,28,,,,
I like the simplicity of the watch app. I'm not sure why the user would need to see their HR though esp if they're trying to fall asleep.,28,,,,
"I like your attempt at making the product more hygenic, that's is aboslutely an issue as more and more people use the product so identifying that is big.",28,,,,
I wish it is more high resolution and true to scale. I don't know if it's just like this on my laptop or is it just like this.,28,,,,
I'm a little confused as to why Google Maps is her hack. Unless she takes the information from Hostels/Facebook/Yelp and then use Google maps to cross-reference her choices.,28,,,,
"If the app's main goal is to help gamers get enough sleep, then maybe the app could set up a recommended alarm clock time to wake up to?",28,,,,
"If you were to create an app, you could display the items using a grid. To add, you could also highlight the uncommon items, like on the receipt.",28,,,,
"Inch scale - I like the simple, minimalist design--however, is the temperature a necessary statistic to display when dealing with light energy savings? Consider removing for more space",28,,,,
"Make sure to clean up the minor textual errors for Tuesday (You have second floor twice in the yard design), and Muir College Apt might be too vague",28,,,,
"Really good set up of problem, however, I believe for this asignment we were supposed to identify a lead user who has already come up with a solution.",28,,,,
Showing how the different sections compete for who is able to start the wave is a little unclear and I am not sure if it would really work.,28,,,,
Tag transcript sounds really good! Like having a way to know what time in the lecture you need to recheck later makes a lot of sense to me.,28,,,,
"Voice is a good way as a input in inch size. However, it should be more intuitive to tell users what users can say to control the system.",28,,,,
please plan one week in advance so that progress can be compared also include development tasks other than those strictly required by the assignment such as any bugs fixed,29,,,,
take a more concrete stance this one gives a little insight but no direction also the jump from necessary belongings to whattowear can be considered fairly arbitrary without justification,29,,,,
someone else cant come up with a distinct prototype from with the pov just from looking at the storyboard if the storyboard itself contains the working of the prototype,29,,,,
there is scope to make it much better given how rich your observations are think deeper and dont let your personal bias if any guide the point of view,29,,,,
try to phrase needs in a more general manner even though they should relate to your observations they shouldnt specifically talk about those or the subjects esp by name,29,,,,
on a different note how would you handle the case when the app cannot suggest a group immediately maybe because not many people have signed up for one yet,29,,,,
the point of view doesnt seem to capture the real reason of why people are not good at cooking why do they not already understand their kitchen and tools,29,,,,
i think you should focus on the fact that there is greater contextual information that is constantly changing as i think that is the unique value of your app,29,,,,
i like how patients can sign in as a guest it is unclear if a scientist or investor can sign in as a guest should they be able to,29,,,,
some of these are featurelike and hence sound like solutions such as enroll in one click what you probably mean is that it should be an intuitive simple process,29,,,,
im sure youve realized by now but you are leaning towards treating the user like a subject also productivity apps are overdone so you need to keep distinguishing yourself,29,,,,
most of these needs were to focused on the tools used for navigation or physical features should focus instead on user confusion or how they react to confusing directions,29,,,,
while its fully functional im certain your team can actually implement the feature of tracking a persons movement along the routes without that your app is only half baked,29,,,,
the skill of playing a game outside of cooking does not translate to actually cooking how can you bridge this gap more how can you augment the cooking experience,29,,,,
i would just do one of the 2 options so that you can guarantee that your results are based off of one change rather than a multitude of factors,29,,,,
i felt bad to deduct another point here for the same reason as the last week but you were supposed to include both weeks development plans side by side,29,,,,
the race idea is creative but this still relies heavily on a timer component a more interesting area is how can we encourage productivity without the use of timing,29,,,,
prototype doesnt seem to show full interactions also from this overview it just seems like an app to input budget info what makes this different from things like mint,29,,,,
for anything that is only to be submitted trial watermarks are just fine however if it has to be presented try to use other free tools that arent noticeable,29,,,,
its good that youre taking inspiration from strava but be careful not to make an app too similar to strava what can you do instead to set yourself apart,29,,,,
i wish the app had a visible timer you can test if a visible timer that counts up or down motivates people to stay focused on their assigned task,29,,,,
"2) On the 4th screen of the inch scale, what happens if bars or tables are not available? Would the interface only display one of the options? or both?",29,,,,
"As the final presentation, you can include the screen of presentation, which allow users to go through the video when they are taking note without going to another page.",29,,,,
"Especially at the inch scale, I think the design looks very simple and organized. All of the information that one would need is clearly displayed at an appropriate scale.",29,,,,
"For future iterations, could it be possible to draw out other functions? I don't play the game but there should be space for more interaction outside of the game.",29,,,,
"For the watch interface, if the breathing and heartbeat of the user is good, then the text or image should turn green, indicating that the user's state is positive.",29,,,,
I like that there is a separate beginning workflow for drivers but I wish it were not so small so maybe you can make the driver's entry part bigger.,29,,,,
"I like the idea of giving someone more creative and interactive tools, Im a little lost so more detail woud be great, but it seems like an interesting topic",29,,,,
"I like the idea of improving one of Snapchat's flaws, but how much more creative can you be when designing an interface/interaction for this? Just something to think about!",29,,,,
"I like your idea and I can see how important this can be for people in such a situation, both for EMTs and people asking help for real emergency.",29,,,,
I think that the interface has a lot of functionality but I was wondering if you could add options to fill out or add more tax write up forms.,29,,,,
I wish you can categorize buttons or screens by funtionality and it is better for users to get the visual guide immediatly to familirize the control without much training.,29,,,,
I would like a physical time left during the game or maybe something that tracks time. It would be helpful to know how long each game is on average.,29,,,,
I'm not sure whether there will be a privacy problem for the yard interface becasue not everyone wants to display what he or she has ordered in the public.,29,,,,
"Maybe you should add a way for users to bid or counter offer the posted price, because the poster might not be aware of all the potential costs involved",29,,,,
My hunch is that EMT people in such a situation should have a really simple and fast way to send out the report about current situation in current area.,29,,,,
"Normally, the message notification is under the user section. Maybe you can combine the message to the ""Panera Bread(4)"", which can help you make the the top bar cleaner.",29,,,,
"Overall, definitely, a very simple and yet powerful application. I can see myself using this ! It would be much cooler to have different features but good job !!",29,,,,
"Since your persona is loking for all new furniture, maybe you can display sample arrangments of rooms and they can see where to find each item within the room.",29,,,,
"The 3 rectangles take up a ton of space on the screen, they can be better consolidated and more effectively provide the user with input if they were nested",29,,,,
"The bar ""next Due Date"" should be changed to ""Due Dates"" or something. The term next makes me think there will be one thing when I click on it.",29,,,,
"The interface looks intuitive and easy to navigate. I like the use of increasing the text size for the scores, which indicates its importance to the game and user.",29,,,,
"This application is absolutely something I would use, I am okay with walking a little distance if i know I'm getting the lowest price available and save some money.",29,,,,
"This is really interesting. The pad not only supports laying down, but also supports standing against the wall when not in use. Very smart and efficient use of space",29,,,,
"Who is the interface for? The event planners? Or the people who need rides. If it's for planners, you'd want it to be easy to change passengers and drivers.",29,,,,
the last storyboard isnt really distinct from the 2nd one snoozing is a fine functionality to present but a better way would be to try explaining it as a need,30,,,,
note since the link provided is codeinsuitsgithubionewhealthfund the corresponding repository would have been graded which we will expect from the next assignment which doesnt have a json at the moment,30,,,,
at first i thought the observations centered around a general daytoday history but in the end the focus arranged around students learning experiences which i think is a good choice,30,,,,
way too much text on this storyboard also what is this storyboard trying to convey intimidation in cooking or not knowing how to cook those are two separate user needs,30,,,,
point awarded because you have the right idea of the point of view but i think you could better apply this to a more specific activity than simply playing games,30,,,,
i dont think number of pages is an appropriate variable to measure here number of clicks before clicking find missions might be a better measure of what youre looking for,30,,,,
theres a bug on the httpregionpoolxyzdashdestination page clicking on the suggested cross streets cities does not populate the text box only if i hit the enter button does it populate,30,,,,
not sure what the difference is between the content in preparation instructions and the method selected in all meal components i think having real content would have made it clearer,30,,,,
the video does demonstrate how the app is used but it does not reveal who the potential users are which is why i could not reward you with the point,30,,,,
after creating a topic bubble and entering the bubble i am unable to add more topic bubbles this only happens when i create the bubble at the top most level,30,,,,
point of view should be more concise for example your point of view would be fine even after the second the sentence as it captures the main problem of engagement,30,,,,
you didnt provide a solution to the user need the user was still left disappointed i dont see the user interacting with your app to have hisher user need satisfied,30,,,,
"About your foot sensor design, I am still doubting whether a normal foot toe movements might cause sending a false signal. But I guess we could just assume it works",30,,,,
"Change ""Cancel"" to ""Cancel my ticket"" to maintain consistency. ""Cancel"" button should have less visual weight since it's a secondary button. You don't want the user to click on that",30,,,,
"For idea 1 interface, it is better to have a desciption section for student's reply. Students can description their works, which helps buyers to choose the best one they like.",30,,,,
"For sleep, food, and exercise, i really like how there is a search function but I would recommend adding filters to each category. It would make the search more efficient.",30,,,,
I can see the app accidentally being triggered during a workout when the user forgets to say work out. How can the app distinguish between danger and a normal activity,30,,,,
"Is there any reason car info is displayed twice? I think if you only represented it on the right, the space on the left could be used for something else.",30,,,,
It might be better to specify the detailed scenario of your persona for different scale so that you may have a better idea of what to design in each interface.,30,,,,
It seems to be cumbersome that the user has to wear sensors to determine posture. Try to find alternative ways to detect motion (video tracking) that don't inconvenience the user.,30,,,,
It's hard to know where to look first and to know which info is most important. Perhaps utilizing different font weights and text decorations could help with emphasizing relevant information.,30,,,,
It's limiting to have the info screen only show up when you point the camera at something. Why not just have it show the closest art piece to your location?,30,,,,
"Or even better, to have colorerd background on the watch to indicate good and bad, and have text on it to show what is the suggestion of postures right now.",30,,,,
"Perhaps maybe a simulated picture mode - displaying items in a virtual fridge, with icons indicating how fresh the food is / how urgently the food needs to be eaten",30,,,,
"The heatmap idea is cool, but if the purpose of the design is to find available study rooms then maybe this space could be used to better represent the rooms.",30,,,,
"The recovery view is very useful, a fitness assistant that factors in your ideal rest time and suggests workouts for you based on the ideal muscle groups is very applicable",30,,,,
great job i enjoyed the consistent interaction flow aesthetics throughout the prototype and that is why i rewarded extra points im looking forward to its complete implementation in the coming week,31,1,0,1,
think about how you can wizardofoz a concept that will be taught soon but you can see the video earlier the spotify integration since the idea hinges on it good work,31,,,,
there are unique interactions in the app but theyve been poorly explained here and bunched along with those that are either auxiliary or not really unique less is more at times,31,,,,
the needs are examples of what you can achieve through the outsourcing process itself rather than what users needs are for the mechanism of outsourcing that you will come up with,31,,,,
the video only shows the aspect of the app where users can find deals theres no mention of your other features such as other people putting coupons shown in the video,31,,,,
i couldnt find the part that reflects on what kinds of things you found heuristic evaluation valuable for and what kinds of things its not very useful for in your experience,31,,,,
as per the instructions the purpose of that screen to give us an idea of how you expect users to interact with it which is missing hence the point is docked,31,,,,
i wish the pov focused more on the problem why the subjects ended up failing to track the necessary information about nutritional intake and then its ultimate relation to health complications,31,,,,
youre still in good shape keep going and it will be a great app dragging the button is somewhat sloppy see if you can use a better maybe even simpler animation,31,,,,
apart from creatingviewing a workout i dont see any other tasks possible the app should definitely do more talk to me or any other ta about the scope of your app,31,,,,
some of your needs are too tied to some sort of technology the needs should be very focused on behavior and motivation of language learning rather than the tools they use,31,,,,
"A little confused by the solution and it seems like it may be too general purpose, don't give them the freedom to choose their layout, design the perfect layout for them.",31,,,,
"At the inch scale, It might be hard to distinguish table from table. I could see people with larger fingers having trouble clicking one table over another with such small buttons.",31,,,,
"Because this is a new technique, I wish you can add more details on the interface about the project to allow users to learn more about the project with further information.",31,,,,
"I like the idea, but why not take it further and make an interactive board that the professor can use to add templates or autocomplete what they're writing on the board?",31,,,,
I think your design uses space a lot better after the in class feedback! I wish there were more colors. You can add colors to buttons or text to differentiate them.,31,,,,
"I'm unsure as to what the ""Mark as duplicate"" button does. Do you press this when you see symptoms listed twice? Does one then get deleted? How do you decide which?",31,,,,
"Ideally, I believe the public display is like a giant Skype so that trainer and trainee can both see each other's body and trainee can give feedbacks in the real time",31,,,,
Just a small thing; wouldn't we want to see that accepted is green? And that rejected would be a different color? I'd suggest you work on which colors indicate which priority,31,,,,
"Out of curiosity, how would this be able to support multiple people? If I remember correctly, Melee supports up to 4 players at once; how would you implement this interface then?",31,,,,
"Really like how clean it looks but would recommend not using that shade of blue for everything, it is hard to tell the difference among keys. Would recommend a different color!",31,,,,
"The buttons for music/mode should be larger, especially on the watch interface. I think it would also be itneresting to play with a swipe interface to select either mode or music.",31,,,,
The design for the schedule is not intuitive. Maybe you could have some symbols or color lump to better visualize the schedule. Show more graph features than words for this section,31,,,,
"The only thing I would add to this is switching the desk to a sitting-standing desk, so that he can continue to work without worrying about his physical posture or comfortability.",31,,,,
You could utilize a different text color for the friends with the longest snap streaks to make the content more salient. Doing this would also create a logical sense of hierarchy.,31,,,,
update since you have used a database it effectively negates losing the point for not using data for the core functionality but you still need to do it for the next assignment,32,,,,
no dead ends per say but links do not open projects filtering does not work and one of the major features of your app uploading a project doesnt seem to do anything,32,,,,
nicely done however this isnt really possible with a web app so it might be wise to choose another idea or pivot please let me know if you need to discuss this,32,,,,
what i really liked about this point of view is that you observed different kinds of activities and found a general pov that penetrates the painpoints you found from each of them,32,,,,
good job overall but there wasnt any description of what kinds of things you found heuristic evaluation valuable for and what kinds of things its not very useful for in your experience,32,,,,
instead of user needs your list details possible solutions an example for the first case would be users need an easier way to lock their bikes to posts more efficiently and effectively,32,,,,
im not sure what really has improved from the previous iteration im assuming most things are under the hood which is good but not always adequate given the focus of this class,32,,,,
good job on your assignment the interviews and insights found were very thorough and interesting your pov is also very strong and provides a lot of opportunities keep up the good work,32,,,,
make sure to actually use the plan check things off as you are done and estimate the time needed for each task plan one week in advance ie for the next milestone,32,,,,
also at least one of the needs focus on solutions srinivas needs simple dropdowns and functionalities to navigate websites you may ask what is it that having a dropdown interface can solve,32,,,,
the video is well paced interesting way of using a sequence of images that are not too discontinuous however the potential users hinted are too specific try to make it more general,32,,,,
on the map screen if i click view larger map it just takes me to google maps how will the info i input into google maps be relayed to the app itself,32,,,,
"For me, the content is lacking a bit. I understand it is a simple use case but as such, I would like to see some interesting/unconventional interface instead of simply a tablet.",32,,,,
"For the watch interface, I would recommend not having the list of groceries and instead have a google map/siri telling you where to go to get your items at the grocery store.",32,,,,
"I am bit confused by the ""Send Notification"" and ""Note Participant. They are similar to me. If they are not, maybe you can change the term ""note participant"" to a clearer name.",32,,,,
I am not sure how the 3D objects would work with the 2D screen. Is there a way to interact the with the 3D object to project them into the 2d screen_,32,,,,
I don't know what this number means. Time I've spent in the room? Time left in the room? Where is the interface for selecting which room and for the length of time?,32,,,,
I don't think there is a need to show all 4 years at once. It should show your current year and let you select other years if you wish to view them.,32,,,,
"I like how simple the inch UI is, but I think that what the user needs to know is whether or not they need to do something. Maybe just stick to reminders?",32,,,,
"I like the blue shades you have but I think it makes some of the text hard to read like shade of blue with ""fourth."" I would maybe try a different blue.",32,,,,
I wish the app makes a distinction than adding a function to uber or lyft. For now it does not seem interesting enough.And I'm also confused what does the button setting do?,32,,,,
"I'm curious to see what UI design you come up with - would it integrate using ASCII values to sort lists of users, or some sort of graphical interface to manually group?",32,,,,
Im concerned with the use of the toes because they are very hard to move individually. Also how will the user know that they sent the right signal? Is there any feedback,32,,,,
"interfaces are nice, but buttons look a little small - especially for the inch interface. Keep in mind most people won't be able to fit 3 fingers on the screen at once",32,,,,
"It would be better to have the public display shows the recommended combo of fitness goals, because it reckon it would be a display on the wall of a gym or somthing.",32,,,,
It would be nice if the tablet shows your class schedule on the weekly view and the events in that view so you know how each event may fit in your schedule.,32,,,,
"It would be really cool to expand the buttons to allow for pencil gestures to trigger formatting. For example, putting a square around a line of text converts it into a header",32,,,,
"Not sure about the alarm clock UI because it seems like you are showing too much, I would recommend showing the upcoming alarms or have something you can scroll through the alarms.",32,,,,
"On the yard scale, I like how you have the current action showing at the bottom of the screen. It gives a live update of how the user is modifying the system.",32,,,,
"Please explain more in-depth how one would have the glasses start its task - i.e. how the glasses know that he is baking brownies, how the glasses know he needed help, etc",32,,,,
"Probably one thing that is needed by puzzle solver is that they need a way to manage their pieces, since with 1000 pieces it is easy to have some pieces got lost.",32,,,,
"Switching between users should be changed, I don't think people will use or even see the user names so possibly where it says 'Pantry' that could be changed to reflect the user.",32,,,,
while your p value is indeed 05 it is more better standard practice to report it at its greatest degree of significance which in this case is 01 so your pvalue is p01,33,,,,
one point of extra credit for the drawing art implementation make sure you make it clear exactly what the purpose of your app is and differentiate it from simply a drawing art app,33,,,,
tip mark stretch goals with a different colorbghighlight rather than a dedicated column also try to format it such that it can be seen at a glance rather than being on different pages,33,,,,
interesting observation of what and how different people maintain some of their past histories it could be a little challenging to come up with a more concrete and unifying core need to tackle,33,,,,
by adding extremely low level details about how to use the app on the script youre likely going to bias the user and not allow them to explore the app on their own,33,,,,
i think the kind of comments you received from the other team is valid i also suggest looking into how to build the navigational flow and the main page more informative and intuitive,33,,,,
think about deadlines so that you are on track each week also mention some stretch goals finally tasks should be more specific and actionable ps please select all relevant pages in the pdf,33,,,,
the indicated user need is not unfulfilled in todays world with sites such as glassdoor and hence not really a need try to dig deeper about what heshe is unable to find easily enough,34,,,,
honestly i think the current grade was as generous as possible i had differing opinions for two rubric items which i have explained but since they negate each other the final grade is unchanged,34,,,,
"the pov is interesting but a little too focused on the solution 
 college students new grads need a tool to keep track of their networking activities with other connections in different source of communications",34,,,,
by the way how do you feel about implementing the done button of the tasks view to reflect the chance in the home view ie clicking done removes the upcoming event from the home,34,,,,
some of the changes you suggested are cosmetic different naming the size of the button etc and i think the focus should have been more on other important questions raised from your heuristic evaluations,34,,,,
the base activity youre observing is not too clear its great that youre thinking of changing the status quo but this exercise is about finding situations where it may be necessary to begin with,34,,,,
great job in implementing the overall functionality of the app although im excited for this development i also think that there is some potential for future improvement in both its aesthetics and the user interface,35,,,,
i think you took detailed notes the subjects response to your interviews however i wish you mentioned in greater detail about the breakdowns and successes that the users faced as that was a bit unclear,35,,,,
we believe your team deserves extra credit because the app had few bugs and has improved a lot from last week make sure to add some color other than that great job keep it up,35,,,,
this pov focuses on the solution of having more accurate data instead your pov should focus maybe on the fact that navigation is difficult because the environment is always changing or the confusion in navigating,35,,,,
it relates to the pov and a storyboard but im not sure what main concept of the app is besides being a way for users to input info about their dog from the prototype alone,35,,,,
the development plan structure is kinda confusing also it does not lay out who is dedicated to each task it might be easier to organize by assignment and by task rather than by individual days,35,,,,
sufficient but i also want to see more discussion about how you are fitting in with the brief what changes would you make with respect to that try to incorporate that in the next assignment,35,,,,
some of your needs are quite insightful but others are more related to improving games rather than the behavior i especially liked the need you stated about having a busy mode in the physical world,35,,,,
i think the race idea is interesting but try to think outside the realm of timers and task lists those ideas have all been done before planningscheduling apps are on my taboo list for that reason,36,,,,
like i said in studio you might want to consider making the main page more visible and intuitive giving a clear sight of what your app provides and what possible outcomes does a user can expect,36,,,,
some of the comments could have fallen in other heuristic categories ie used x to go back but panel 3 used a back arrow is listed under aestheticminimalist design when it should likely go under consistency,36,,,,
good plan 4 hours for a title font good thing you labeled it as a stretch goal this is secondary add a task to find research articles that better motivate your choice of data game dynamics,36,,,,
thank you for an awesome quarter you guys rocked enjoy the winter break and hope you earned some insight and inspiration from this course hope you a great new start for whatever youre trying to achieve next,37,0,0,0,
i can appreciate how the forcefulness of the nudge is important but it doesnt justify a second prototype and should be part of the original one which would also improve it in terms of the flexibility heuristic,37,,,,
think about how you can implement this if you choose this idea especially the automated voice since it is an important part of the app also look at existing apps to find if this is indeed new,37,,,,
like i said in studio you would like to think about how your app fits in the entire cycle of networking right now it focuses on the initial interaction of collecting and exchanging contact information or resumes,37,,,,
some of the needs are weakly connected to the observation or its breakdown for example it should be developed as a plugin as well in case user does not want to install another app to their phone,37,,,,
instead of specifying which person had a need i would have recommended to make it more generalthat is replacing andrew edwin and michael with user and making google calendar theta tau rush events etc with calendar events,37,,,,
decent but youre close to simply reiterating the pov of personal informatics with respect to finances keep in mind this is now taboo so consider a multifaceted approach or a facet of life that is not finances,37,,,,
i am not sure why you have 2 navigation menus hamburger and kabob as a new user i would be confused as to which serves as the main menu perhaps change the icon of one of them,37,,,,
furthermore this may not be the best ab test to do because besides the big orange button on the middle of the screen what else would they click it might be better to do a different test,37,,,,
please provide the old plan too both in a readable format avoid links tip some columns can be removed others can be resized export the plan as a pdf and join pages online rather than using screenshots,37,,,,
this is a decent point of view it combines a comment on people and their lives as well as incorporates motivation for citizen science do more background research into scientific questions that are usually asked in this domain,38,,,,
to further expand the relevant design space i suggest observing people who participate in book clubs people who read leisurely and summarize what they have read in some form or people who try to find what to read,38,,,,
i like the profiles for your users for scientists i wish there was a way to see their entire background maybe provide a link to a webpage outside your app that has more indepth information about the researcherinvestor,38,,,,
the page titled task it have many buttons but none of them seem to be fully implemented yet also the tasks button only duplicates the current window into a new tab please check out the video below httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvg5t46bpxxyk,38,,,,
your pov states past medical information and also that there is not a simple way to access these histories but there seems to be no way to access the historical information the 4th screen of the first prototype,38,,,,
make sure to inform users via the interface itself how the recommended activities are chosen and what the set intervals button does i get it from your written summary but the interface doesnt talk about breaks too clearly,38,,,,
interesting idea i like how you interviewed different types of musicians and were able to zone in on the major issues of song writing and collaboration your user needs are unique and insightful overall great job at needfinding,38,,,,
be sure to explicitly state what you are planning on measuring with the ab test also you seem to want to track a lot and that may not be possible try focusing on just one aspect to test,38,,,,
im assuming that making your personality transparent means that youre making your personality information available to others rather than making your personality not unique transparent as if it can be applied anywhere without a significant change for example,38,,,,
some of the needs are dependent on the platforms specific feature types and thinking about having those features or not might bring some insights as to why certain interfaces are designed in their respective ways both bloggers need a way to easily see changes in their follower count and which specific accounts are following or unfollowing them ie other bloggers accounts or business accounts alyssa needs an easier way to sort out pictures to check if her photo will fit in well,38,,,,
youre changing more than 1 thing Ê«one being the actual ui going from buttons to drop down and the second being that youre limiting the number of choices from any number to less than or equal to 3,38,,,,
the only thing is that it is not explicitly clear that the app is supposed to a cleaning app among roommates or housemates also the currency system is not well explained how do users use their earned currency,38,,,,
its unclear how to clear the goat i like your teams concept for this app and i think you can do a lot with that idea but a lot of the functionality isnt working yet or isnt completely clear,39,,,,
great pov one suggestion is to put this statement into a context for example how does this statement relate to friends who want to join social events how does it relate to friends who want to organize such events,39,,,,
really great job this week we believe you guys went above and beyond the criteria of this assignment the app may have a few bugs but the interactions are there and has improved from last week keep it up,39,,,,
the way the app looks now makes this seem more about creativity rather than stress this isnt necessarily a bad thing but if your pov is about stress the stress component needs to be more clear within the app,39,,,,
facebookyelp could be more unique examine lis 5 stage model and consider a multifaceted approach your idea might become more interesting if focused on a different stage of the personal informatics model generally preparation reflection and action are underrepresented,39,,,,
i think you could have improved on explaining the specific breakdowns and successes that your subjects encountered during their activity some of the user needs were redundant overall i like the activity that you chose good job at needfinding,39,,,,
it was interesting to see how people engage with various platforms to track their daily activities would there be any design opportunity neglected by not considering nonplatform usage though are you trying to develop a platform specific enhancement idea,39,,,,
time estimation is missing although i mentioned that i look at hours spent more importantly to gauge even work distribution among the team members without providing time estimation of each task i cant give constructive advice about your task design,40,1,0,1,
no github link provided in the submission informing us postdeadline helps you get the code graded but does not fetch the point the purpose of this rubric item is to avoid overhead which is important for such a large class,40,,,,
not clearly linked to citizen science look more into scientific questions within this domain to better motivate your design figure out a way to make the user more than just a subject but an actual contributor to the scientific process,40,,,,
doesnt take the current location and destination of the driver bob might be going from warren to scripps whereas the user needs to get from scripps to warren in which case the user cant really hitch a ride with bob,40,,,,
for the remind johnny finish reflection page i was confused as to why there were more than one person on the list when you are just reminding johnny i wish the reminders only reminded the person involved with the task,40,,,,
see previous rubric item for more focus less on the reminders too if i didnt say that already not core functionality but very close to it good candidate for wizard of ozzing focus more on the data and the visualizations,40,,,,
there should definitely be some pointers about what is being represented for the benefit of new users since it is not clear otherwise tip what is covered in the textual explanation should end up as part of the onboarding process,40,,,,
your distribution of work is uneven be sure that everyone is contributing a fair amount if this means a member isnt as comfortable with coding then they should be taking care of more of the design or user testing components,40,,,,
your team is showing good progress with the application and the interactions are there i would suggest polishing up a few componentseg the drawerand finishing implementing the missing pageseg the page when clicking on the bottom left of the drawer,40,,,,
also think about stretch goals it could be good to have those defined so that you can have a little bit of buffer when things get busy stretch goals could be some of the goals for the coming weeks for example,41,1,1,1,
use better git commit messages aggj fgsdbb etc arent real messages having better messages makes rolling back easier in case a commit breaks your system you can look at some sample commit messages from a repo i was working on httpsgithubcomaloksmcrowdsbackendcommitsmaster,41,1,1,1,
some tasks are not specific or actionable enough such as implement setting page also include time estimates and appropriate deadlines week 6 has all on the same day accounting for any off daysholidays the whole purpose is to use the plan,41,,,,
leaves too much to the imagination and you create bias by telling them too specifically what to do and what the app is about we also want to know how they respond to the site prima facie without any knowledge beforehand,41,,,,
think about stretch goals and deadlines within the week also make sure to plan at least one week ahead tasks for a5 arent owned by team members yet the entire purpose is to use the plan to keep things going well,41,,,,
reflection pinpoints the major problems of the other teams two prototypes however the paragraph is missing your thoughts on heuristic evaluations therefore i could not reward you the point good insights on your hes and solutions to the other teams problems,41,,,,
"it would have been better if some of the need statements were more explained student needs a better way to view upcoming assignments better than what
 student needs a better way to differentiate between assignments for different classes better in what way",41,,,,
interesting concept of racing against friends to do tasks what i think might be more unique is thinking of ways to hold friends accountable for their tasks and tasks should not be limited to homework as this should be more generalizable,41,,,,
its fine to fake it this week but there should be some substance too by a8 esp for extra points point docked as there is little auxiliary functionality such as editing major leavingchanging a group that make the app relatively static,41,,,,
i just realized youve recreated a questionanswer forum lol i think the way you distinguish it is by everything being more data driven i think the best way to do this is to force all of your data to be numerical,41,,,,
if you click on the current location icon on the top left it throws an error saying geolocation error only secure origins allowed this is because it hasnt been loaded over https but if loaded over https your map doesnt load,41,,,,
some tips add messages that inform your users that a task is created currently in progress or completed also inform the users that they officially blocked websites this will ensure that the app is meeting the visibility of system status heuristic,41,,,,
some tasks for your code 2 screens section are rather vague you could improve this by breaking up the coding into separate tasks of html css javascript coding in general be a bit more specific about what exactly each task entails,41,,,,
the second wireframe doesnt make it obvious to anyone who sees this that the two field panes can be used to select fields in the manner you demoed earlier this week without the demo i would have thought those were links,41,,,,
while you did present a good list of changes some of them did not relate well to the heuristics mentioned heuristic evaluations are more about the interactions within the app rather than the features or the playability experience in this case,41,,,,
try to make it more elaborate youre not just trying to satisfy the storyboard but also associated needs and expectations of a user would they need to create activities every week how can they duplicate a workout to avoid repeated input etc,42,,,,
your tasks are too generic and broad more detail please for instance i have no idea what your app actually does from reading the plan when i should be able to tell what functionality you plan to implement by reading the plan,42,,,,
there might be some design space left to think about how to streamline the overall process i believe all the steps involved in creating a post of a place demonstrated in the video prototype are necessary but could it be further simplified,42,,,,
the idea of observing what types of consoles a person plays with does not relate to games with a purpose the point of the brief is to explore how the motivational and rewarding aspects of games can influence behavior in everyday life,42,,,,
awesome data input screen you shouldnt have a question about punishment positive reinforcement only no reward if no work reward if work also emotion degree isnt very intuitive apply your experience with heuristic evaluation i need a better orientation to the data,42,,,,
almost finished but the part where user uploads her clothes is not fully functional also clicking the buy it button doesnt operate as expected some of the items seems to be added to my closet but some are not check out httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlljp2gfztwk,42,,,,
since we do not penalize twice for the same mistake this point is not docked this time around please note that we only grade one repo per team you must aggregate work as the total is not simply the sum of the parts,43,,,,
the instructions are clear but there isnt really a script it might be useful to develop a script that places the user in a scenario where they might want to add a new location as this would be more realistic to your app,43,,,,
interesting observation of what selforganization means for different individuals however i felt it a little difficult to unify the diversity of activities to this pov for example does ivan having only 10 knives require a lot of work for him to organize them,43,,,,
i think the pov itself is a valid statement but im not sure if it can be extrapolated from the activity observed especially because the observation was centered around a specific platform that happens not to have certain features required for the activity,43,,,,
user needs should be in the form similar to user needs something it should address what the user is trying to get done and the needs they have to get them there your statements offer solutions and are not addressed to the user,43,,,,
the best povs are nowhere near recommending a specific solution and instead are a comment on people and important aspects of life some examples are library books are valuable yet underutilized people want to do good deeds but life gets in the way,43,,,,
great job in running through the finish line and polishing up the app thank you for an awesome quarter you guys rocked enjoy the winter break and hope you earned some insight and inspiration from this course now off to a great new start,44,0,0,0,
try to make it glanceable to improve usability tasks such as work on ajax requests are vague and not actionable enough finally the graphs can be moved at the end as they dont serve a purpose except when you are changing the plan itself,44,,,,
be careful with budget apps because most of them end up looking like mint or simply being a budget input app the garden idea is pretty interesting and i think you should focus more on how to take advantage of those sorts of rewards,44,,,,
point awarded because this does connect to one of your storyboards but its unclear how this is different from most map applications is this just a map with better search results how does this apply to the studio brief of games with a purpose,44,,,,
i like the scenario in which you frame the task but the task is very general and a user might get confused as to how to successfully accomplish try specifying your task a bit more to get the user to do something more concrete,44,,,,
interesting needs found from the list but i wish it focused more on why than the solution for example calling is sometimes preferedsic over texting for those direct interaction such as hanging out there should be a way to store it in history too,44,,,,
good job in creating the first version of the app i think there is still some potential for improvement and the fact that there is no interactivity associated with the tree visualization other than adding and deleting a member affects the apps usability and attractiveness,45,,,,
good job on this weeks assignment on the development plan the tasks can be more specific actionable instead of html template for bills screen it can reword to be display users bills history for example for next weeks development plan update please make these changes,45,,,,
i think its an interesting idea to look at bank transaction records and decode what did the individual do at which time and where but discussing about the confusion the current software applications or having multiple cards incurs is a little stretched from the observation,45,,,,
good job in running through the finish line as a 2person team thank you for an awesome quarter enjoy the winter break and hope you earned some insight and inspiration from this course hope you a great new start in whatever youre trying to achieve next,46,0,0,0,
after reading the unique interaction i find that adding viewing a company application or profile is important but more appropriately considered core functionality something i would suggest as an example is to enable users to be able to notify the their recruiters of their timelines deadlines,46,,,,
plz remove login credentials collect more data about each spot who you went with what you did why it was enjoyable etc improve visualizations pasting in handdrawn images works make it clearer how the map works if you insist on keeping it as an input mechanism,46,,,,
this point of view is more a comment on citizen science interfaces themselves what id rather see is something like citizen science can be used to answer this scientific question as well as describing your point of view as to why that question is important to answer,47,,,,
while i agree that the sample size is smaller than what you would have liked the chisquare test is designed to be more objective for interpreting raw numbers much more so than objective percentages you cant cite percentage differences when you mention that your redesign did better,47,,,,
because of the struggles of the interviewees the observation writeups were very engaging for the next team assignment if your team decides to keep working on this subject it would be beneficial to analyze other banking apps that serve similar purposes and look for latent design opportunities,47,,,,
i would actually argue that the button might lead to faster clicks because it is a button and people are able to interact with buttons much easier than a hamburger menu as common as hamburger menus are in mobile apps they actually have pretty poor information scent,47,,,,
the entire application is centered around ride sharing and the core functionality of the application drivers being able to create rides and riders being able to see potential rides is not working since the main functionality of your application is missing i cannot award you the point,47,,,,
some observations you made contain valuable insights about the design and how its communicated with the users for example we have to listen carefully to comments like itsic was trying to figure out why the feed was motivating i did not really understand the point of it,47,,,,
the protocol is well designed and puts a good focus on the interactions of the applications the core functionality of the application still appears to be missing i would encourage your team to focus on that aspect being able to create projects share them before implementing other features,48,,,,
make sure to actually use the plan and check things off as you go distribute the tasks and not be too specific about the time just ballpark it some tasks are genericvague ex datajson with fake data what data you are faking on which page is not clear,48,,,,
we expect a complete app in that it satisfies reasonable expectations a typical user will have so that it can easily have at least two screens the scope of this app is exceedingly narrow and the second screen is apparently an extension of the first not a different screen,49,,,,
what i really liked about this point of view is that it puts commuting in a context ie the beginning of a long stressful day which made me wonder would there be other contexts that commute might well be placed in for example at the end of the day,49,,,,
great job on the assignment the development plan could be improved by rewording your task names to be more actionable instead of code nutritional facts page put display nutritional facts on the nutrition page when your development plan is updated for a5 reword your tasks to be more actionable,49,,,,
i think the pov you included contains some of the needs and insights you pulled from your observation but not all for example there were several needs related to user frustration linked to not having an efficient convenient way of gathering relevant travel information but that seems to be neglected,50,,,,
another note which is optional but encouraged you can improve your development further by adding in constraints will anyone be working on it during thanksgiving is someone busy with midterms or out of town for a weekend this can make your development plan have more realistic time estimations and goals,50,,,,
to me the most meaningful part of your app is the voting feature that allows users to see and get feedback on their own training habits this is slightly overlooked by the other tasks in your protocol you might want to focus on the core task as the primary function,50,,,,
great job at needfinding i liked how you went into detail about your observations with each subject and the breakdowns they encountered your list of user needs are all unique and insightful overall i like this idea in how it correlates with the theme of bettering the community at home,50,,,,
privacy is secondary functionality for now the alert based on gps is not as important as better clarifying your data and your questions about the data good call on the friends feature thats secondary change 5 is really a good example of what you should be focusing on at this stage,51,,,,
it would be better if i received some sort of confirmation that my eventlocation was successfully shared right now i have to navigate to the recommendations which does not make the most sense there should be some history of my locations recommendations simply implies that those are locations that i might like,52,,,,
the main page could be a little more visual would how many days are you prepping for be the best question to ask the potential users the firsttime user immediately has to make a choice out of 7 options what would the user be thinking at this point of the apps entry,52,,,,
however my general feeling on anonymous posting is that it is hard to shepherd the users to contribute positively to the app and other users in some courses the list of comments already is too long and users have to look into each of them to find the most relevant information they want,53,,,,
some of the needs presented here doesnt directly relate to the breakdowns nor the observations provided for example people need ways to track their past isnt really a need that can be inferred from the observation since they might well be tracking their past ie by uploading pictures or updating statuses on facebook,53,,,,
i like your idea not only is it creative but it also matches the theme of bettering the community of students who are interested in learning new programming languages i like how detailed your observations were in that you were able to take note of their successes and breakdowns overall great job at needfinding,54,,,,
good job this week the development plan can be improved it seems to be missing the time estimations for the task and the tasks can be more specific and actionable instead of finalize unique features you can write display user profile information on the user page as an example next week please make these changes,55,,,,
some of the findings that are listed under not a heuristic could indeed fall under one of the heuristics for example confusing indication of pending requests on home page would fit under match between system and real world because the indication does not match what users have typically come to know as a requests indicator,55,,,,
im not confident that i understood the idea behind the second storyboard by showing a person who originally got rejected from a company getting an offer from the same company after a year with a screen of a mobile device of different company logos did not give a concrete idea of how this app operates,55,,,,
please dont reuse links until the previous assignment is graded i tried a few times with incognito but couldnt see the alternative redesign im happy to regrade with a new link as long as you deploy a predeadline commit also unrelated to the grade make sure the links work the first one with www does not,56,,,,
editing tasks does not work also it is unclear for a firsttime user what exactly the unique purpose of the app is if i were a naive user i would assume that the rewards are real money and i would not get the point that it is supposed to be an app to share among houseroommates,56,,,,
what is the specific need that youre addressing try to identify the reason why people are frustrated andor why they have to search for a space is availability unpredictable and why or are they not well acquainted with the campus that might help you go beyond a superficial solution or be able to justify it better,56,,,,
interesting pov personally i would endure extra cognitive and mechanical effort if i could have a good experience overall from cooking not sure if the experience of eating out at a restaurant can be precisely compared to that of cooking on your own but this pov states something that people can relate to which is good,56,,,,
there are many possibilities of what the app can do or how it can do it than the rather limited scope of coming up with a group what if you dont want to work with someone for whatever reason try making it less focused on a behindthescenes algorithm and more about the interactions that will satisfy the pov,58,,,,
it would be great if you could infuse some more insights from observing real users into the prototypes you might want to look into user interactions from various angles during the heuristic evaluation sessions this might be crucial to answering questions like why should i use this instead of or along with amazon kindle or goodreads for example,58,,,,
your needs state a lot of solutions these should only be focused on the users for example instead of your 11th need you could say cashiers need a way to rotate being at the register and performing other duties this need is general enough that multiple solutions could be implemented for it while also capturing the core user need,59,,,,
itd be cool if you could put some recurrent events as fake data then show the distribution of emotions for each of the occurrences of the event also the graphs are all oversized and dont fit on my screen put in a menubar that i can use to select the different visualizations i would make your app more interactive,59,,,,
something that might be better to measure is whether users accept a quest more in the original design or the redesign presumably if the redesign is easier to understand then they should be accepting or completing quests more because they are able to understand the purpose from the page instead of trying to figure out how to navigate the page,60,,,,
theres a slight dead end that i believe could be avoided for now it seems like when you click on comment of the circle and there are no additional comments on it the user just reaches a blank page it might be beneficial to prevent the user from navigating to that page if there are no comments on the circle,60,,,,
it would be useful to sequence the tasks and deadlines in a useful order next break up tasks into specific not generic such as making sure app reads json data and actionable chunks especially for coding also its fine to simply ballpark time estimates instead of going into precise numbers the whole purpose is that the team uses the plan easily,61,,,,
good job on mostly finishing the functionality thinking about the cold start problem ie users who have just started using the application might give you some insight about how to restructure some of the interaction flow right now signing up with a new account leads to the same view as trung one extra point was rewarded for implementing interactive graph rendering,61,,,,
good you get the basics of the brief but your writing is still missing details about how you are pivoting our main idea is to make the analysis of the users personal data useful to user as feedback in other words to help the users fight against procrastination through the data thats not really saying very much what data what analysis,61,,,,
a3 feedback good job at your he heuristic names should be fully stated controlfreedom to user control and freedom metaphors to match between system and real world i wish the list of he went more in depth explaining exactly why it violated that heuristic as some of were questionable for example how does reliance on submenus for core functions violate aestheticminimalist design,62,,,,
even though the storyboards do correspond with the pov of allowing the community to voice their problems the main issue seems to revolve around parking so if someone else were to pick up these storyboards they might think that the pov has something to do with solving the issues of parking rather than allowing communities to voice their opinion about all issues,62,,,,
there might be some design space left to think about how to incentivize users to come back to the platform after they decided their classes some students might be willing to know more detailed information about the structure of the course or how the workload changes over the quarter for example maybe we can gather more information about the quarter mid 3quarter checkpoints,63,,,,
great job this week development plan seems wellthoughtout however the tasks can be more specific and actionable instead of code homepage write display create task run task settings logout help buttons on the home page not only is this a requirement but it allows the team to know in great detail what should be done so for next weeks update include these changes,63,,,,
to understand the various situations and interaction between the app and the users creating a reusable prototype like made out of a piece of plywood for example and carrying it around for a length of time a week for example could be helpful i think particularly paying attention to someone who just finished preparing for the weeks worth of meals could be beneficial,63,,,,
this prototype focuses solely on running but your pov is more general than that are you only doing a running app how does this app differ from other running apps i suggest doing a competitive analysis of other fitness apps to gain inspiration but also to ensure that you dont do something exactly similar this seems very much like the nike running app,63,,,,
i wish the splash page 1st screen had a slogan of what your application does food for thought can be about anything food related try to narrow it down to the main functionality and explain in a short sentence the goal of your app for example slacks slogan is were on a mission to make your working life simpler more pleasant and more productive,64,,,,
given that most of your users confusion stemmed from not understanding the training icon as opposed to visiting the dog profile your ab test should probably focus more on that aspect its difficult to measure how many clicks it takes for a user to find something because this could be confounded with a number of factors and is not directly linked to a particular action,65,,,,
video feedback i enjoyed watching the video and i thought the acting was great especially the ending with hungs extreme satisfaction from watching the video i like how the interface of your prototype was simple one thing i am wondering about is does the app only block websites or does it block other apps too think about how feasible it will be to implement this,65,,,,
i think theres a little tension between the two questions at stake how would we effectively in terms of what importance of the event record and represent our past vs how can we record our past in a complete manner such that we can always go back and look for the things when we forget we would eventually like to focus on one to the other,66,,,,
a3 feedback nice he and thorough explanations of your feedback like i said before i wish a comparison was provided between the other teams prototypes to help them understand the advantages and disadvantages of their design going forward think about the possible ways to upload your notes through the video it seems that your notes have to be typed up into the appthat sounds a bit tedious,67,,,,
also you might want to think about the current flow of the app if its primary purpose is to make people meet other people then why not just have them at least be able to browse and see other people out there in the platform and if they think there are quite a few interesting people then require them to input the mbti type for making matches,67,,,,
great job observing users and distilling insights from them however this specific rubric item asked to collect and group notes for each observant first before distilling insights because a concrete user scenario which contributes to storytelling and building a persona is often powerful even when in a breakdown scenario here the grouping is somewhat vague and the users identity is washed off but still very detailed and structured observations,69,,,,
these needs are too focused on the idea of a calendar the calendar is the solution not the need a better way to word these might be students need a way to know all their events for the day at any point notice that there is no mention of the method in which they would use this some of the needs can also be grouped as the same need,69,,,,
a3 feedback very indepth explanation of your he i like how yall went above and beyond the assignment requirements by providing reflections on your own prototypes images and he worksheets going forward think about how to check if the scientists are providing legitimate research articlesprojects there has been multiple scandals where publication companies do not review articles online resulting in fake information leaking out how will your app avoid this issue,71,,,,
while i like how you are testing the follow button it may be difficult to obtain any significant results from the exp because people may simply like to press the button if you get what i am saying there is essentially nothing that is preventing them from clicking it again such as a new page change so that is why i am somewhat skeptical of what your results will be like,71,,,,
some of the needs are weakly related to their respective breakdowns for example in addition he was looking through a powerpoint about punjabi culturehis culture that he was planning to give to a group of students he stated that he is afraid that the younger generation may not be educated enough about their culture and all together take no notice of it is not a breakdown but is used to suggest needs,72,,,,
its confusing that even though the exercise category doesnt exist possible for novice users the add repetitions button etc still exist at the bottom and do not work thinking about the cold start problem ie users who have just started using the application might give you some insight about how to restructure some of the interaction flow right now signing up with a new account leads to the same view as trung,72,,,,
some of your needs were focused on improving games rather than improving the human behavior i think youre on the right track with some of your insights for example your need a socially awkward or introverted gamer needs a way to connect with others on a deeper level and games can be a spark to a deeper friendship this need is actually really insightful and could be explored with a design solution,72,,,,
dont spend too much time on the heart animation you can just put in html pictures for different levels id like to see other visualizations like a line graph of completed acts of kindness by day week month also you should categorize acts of kindness which you can then visualize at an aggregate level for instance donating money vs donating time then you can compare all the tasks youve done under those categories,73,,,,
overall feedback redesigned page needs improvement the label covers the input text which makes the forum look messy the updown feature to input timedate could be more fluid ie i use the updown button to change the hour but when i want to go to minutes i cant click on minutes to change the time i have to click the right arrow key to move to minutes which isnt ideal through a phone,73,,,,
i like this idea of allowing students help their peers building a sense of community among them as seen in the video the app helps people find seats what other issues are yall planning to solve perhaps narrow it down to one issue or provide categorization find seatsfind parkinghw helpetc having an app that helps a broad range of issues may lead to an app that is just for chatting about miscellaneous topics,73,,,,
good start heres a tool that ive made for myself google eisenhower principle httpsgoogl4yuqgt use it as inspiration for the data you are going to collect then think about what visualizations are going to be most important from the data you collect also think about other facets of ones life that contribute to procrastination relationships healthsleep etc what do you think contributes to procrastination the most if you talk to people about it,73,,,,
i think this prototype doesnt completely connect to the pov as it does not show how its accomplishing the goal of centralizing information the page 4 of the prototype for example is not contributing to the goal any more than what email already does typically a thread of conversation exchanged between an applicant and a recruiter at the company will contain all the information jobview has but an email account typically contains many more,74,,,,
looking at your wireframes i was unsure about the purpose of the emojis why are some circles bigger than others why are some circles offscreen the organization of the app is difficult to understand what is going on and i am unsure about what i should be doing if you are designing the app to look like the wireframe i would advise that you clean up the wireframe such that it is better organized,74,,,,
an interesting idea to look at the activity of reading as historical the observation is detailed and how they interact with their reading material is elaborated however quite a few of the pain points reported can be remedied once we converted the reading material digitally therefore the needs presented are mediumdependent which in turn can be thought as interfacedependent if you think of the medium ink on a a sheet of paper as an interface,75,,,,
and the followings are your need statements the order of presentation isnt consistent with above 1 people need a social timeline platform where they can store all their emotions and easily maybe automatically set visibility to their friends acquaintances and strangers 2 people need a way to store the emotion and get the arty and poetic feeling of handwriting when they are using digital diary 3 people need a way to associate photographs with emotions,75,,,,
from the pov people become forgetful when they are overwhelmed with too much information at once in a short span of time peoples way to learn should be simplified by reducing interactions as much as possible and also reduce computational complexity from the environment and digital device what is the different between reducing computational complexity from the environment and digital device and peoples way to learn should be simplified by reducing interactions as much as possible,76,,,,
a note about your overall pov and idea i could see this app being used for fitness purposes in addition to what you intend ie setting a goal location to run to and racing to get there under a certain time thats not necessarily a bad thing but you should either take advantage of that and capitalize on it or flesh out your original idea a bit more so its more clear that its the main purpose of the app,80,,,,
a3 feedback thorough explanation of your he i like the idea on informing ucsd students about all the food locations on campus going forward think about how this application will cater to both new and old students maps and directions to locations and how to motivate your users to continue using the app offer discounts also ucsd does provide a directory of all the food places on campus and i suggest doing a competitive analysis on their app with your app,81,,,,
some of the needs are focused on the solution rather than the actual feelings of the users independent of the platforms they use for example both student 1 needs update his habits app everyday to be able to have accurate statistics to show his productivity levels and student 2 needs to be able to physically be able to mark offcrossoff tasks completed right after she has completed them involve a specific type of action update the habit app and interface markoffcrossoff capability,82,,,,
your observation was very diverse and engaging i believe the statement describes the current challenge of storing selfhistories into the design space correctly i would like you to think about why it is highly distributed what if people like certain aspects of some platforms and therefore choosing to use them without further understanding what drives them to use specific services and platforms it is hard to ultimately convince others to replace or use sidebyside all of them with the service you will provide,83,,,,
the variables used are not appropriate for a chisquare test because the variables of sessions and views are not categorical meaning they are not mutually exclusive from each other an example of appropriate categorical data would be click or no click on a web page button for the original and variant pages because you cannot both click and not click a button in your calculation you cannot accurately assume how many individual page views were made per session and thus the calculation doesnt fit the test,86,,,,
the app looks amazing so far despite some dead links a few notes i like how every screen informs where the user is currently user at bills screen says bills etc however be sure to add the name of your app on all your screens there also seems to be three ways for navigation profile helpsettinglogout chatbillschores perhaps combine two menus into one ie profile with helpsettinglogout having more than two menus may confuse your users overall great job cant wait to see your progress next week,87,,,,
the instructions are thorough but too specific the task should be more general so as to apply more generally to what a user might do with the app in addition the task doesnt capture the unique interaction of the app as this is typical of most budgeting apps some things i think you will need to think about going forward is how to make your app stand out and why the wishlist feature is important or special at the moment the interactions are highly similar to other budgeting apps,89,,,,
good start your project has the benefit of being very multifaceted and you can go nuts with the type of data you collect i really liked how on fridays youre exhausted tired sad so you used that information to change your schedule come at the data from a more balanced approach placing equal weight to the different facets emotions and productivity seem covered well but what else make sure to drop features that are basically recreating a calendardiary app simplify those so that you can really focus on the interaction with the data,93,,,,
adding a new add friends feature could be an idea to solve the usability issue involved with requiring users to input the email address ie having to pull out ones phone or laptop lookup the persons contact info try to verify which email address out of 3 that the person youre trying to add has the entire sequence of these actions could be really tedious and overwhelming to firsttime users for example but without thinking through the cause of the painpoint theres a fair chance of complicating your system with the new feature while not solving the usability issue,99,,,,
good job at needfinding i liked your ideal overall i think it is very creative and i think you noticed a number of breakdowns which proves that this is a common problem among the community of college students some of the user needs were repetitive and i believe you can definitely dive deeper into this issue for example what are the needs of those who arent concerned with dressing up in the morning how does that compare to those who do take the time to check the weather to wear something appropriate does planning outfits play a role in their social life,102,,,,
great job this week i like where the app is going just make sure to keep nielsens heuristics in mind and include messages that will help the users understand the systems status and diagnose errors the application is also missing some sort of help and documentation login pagesplash page is encouraged to have a summary of what your app does before they enter your app some questions i had can users add classes can users remove themselves from classes what are updates for will viewing the notes show how many likes an dislikes it currently has try to address these questions for user testing,104,,,,
some of the needs sound redundant to me 1 mudit needs a way with lesser interaction to search the words he doesnt know on his smartphone so that he doesnt waste too much time 2 mudit needs a way to save a word with its meaning directly without copy and pasting it on ms word from the pc 3 mudit needs to track the words and their meanings he searches on his smart phone without going through the browser history 4 christopher needs a way to look for the meaning of the word that would not make him leave reading his article in between,104,,,,
sufficient but i also want to see more discussion about the brief the calendar seems like secondary functionality focus more on the data and the questions you are asking so far i only see the question how do these events make me feel flesh out more relevant information you would collect with less attention to the events timing information you dont really need a calendar for the timing information just a start and end time and a date sure it makes looking over the weeks events easier but a normal calendar app can do that i suggest rethinking how you want to visualize time for the user,107,,,,
about the remindthework feature i urge you to observe users in a reallike situation what users actually want could be something very different from what you think is needed for them for instance maybe you will learn that what users are most curious at any given time of scheduling their own workload is to have an answer for the question how am i doing what is the most optimal task to do next given that i have done x y and z recently maybe you might want to design an instant performance review feature or a search recommendation system that lets users search for specific tasks of interest,108,,,,
the pov is very interesting if we were to provide some sort of visual artifacts that could potentially increase our ability to recall the question is how would we be able to summarize it and make it not cumbersome on an extreme end one could continuously record every second of ones life but does it provide any value then if the video is 24 hours long but if were only given 24 hours a day as well on the other hand if we summarized it and recorded only the important piece of information wouldnt we still be losing stuff since we lose things when we are most unaware of them,110,,,,
a3 feedback thorough explanation of your hes i think this idea of creating an app that helps keep others in check is interesting its a lot more personal when someone reminds you to do something rather than an alarm going forward think about how to motivate your users to remind each other will they get some type of reward if they complete their tasks on time or when the person is an allstar leader and always reminds people to do their work will they get some type of recognition too also think about the situation of when the all parties of the group forget to remind each other what should happen,111,,,,
however i found that some needs are not connected to and corroborated by the observations nor the breakdowns reported for example the followings are the parts in your observation that contain the word emotion 1 in weibo she tends to post negative and angry emotions when she is down which she says is because there is less acquaintances in weibo in friend circle on the other hand she always post positive stuff in order to show the best of her to her friends 2 she also uses selfiestick to shoot videos during her traveling because she thinks it is hard to store emotion in photos 3 she concluded that handwriting can stores emotions for her,115,,,,
i found some of the needs presented are weakly connected to the activity you observed use their computers and visit sitesmediums in which they were viewing news stories andor keeping track of personal information of any sort and the pov bringing in visuals in place of large chunks of small text could potentially stimulate the brain more than just reading through the material word for word and trying to comprehend what each word means santpreet needs a way to better understand stock rises falls and predictions because as a businessfinance major this material is very relevant to him santpreet needs a fun and fresh way to bring more cultural awareness to his community of fellow punjabis,116,,,,
the app is so cute i like the icons and the splash page the home page and restaurant page have clearcut features some of the pages ex affordability do not have back buttons and the hamburger menu icon doesnt seem to do anything next week please ensure that the menu works and back buttons are added speaking of back buttons the back button on the home page should be removed unless it has an important functionality the home page should be an introductory page for the users so it would be confusing if the user saw a back button they would think they are not on the home page overall i am liking where you guys are going and i cant to see your update next week,127,,,,
i think the list of changes you made are great but im concerned that the effect of different pieces of changes included in the new version might make the test result harder to analyze for example on the matches page not only each persons profile has been changed from a list view to a grid view but also now there are buttonlooking buttons compared to the original linklooking buttons for chat on the top of the page right under matches it indicates what kind of person youre looking for as well which might also affect the users mental state this is important since this change isnt necessarily following the same logic as with others mainly about how peoples profiles are laid out in the view therefore i recommend you to separate out some of those changes and create different urls that contain individual changes and compare the result,148,,,,
beautiful and wellfunctioning app i like the unique features you have so far some notes the home button should always be visible your app logo is cute use it as an easy access to the home page the page after you sign in speaking of the home page remove the back button to the login page because the user already logged in they should only be able to return to this page when they signed out i like how the pages are informative about the restaurant and dishes as a user i would be interested in what the dish or the restaurant might look like add images to help your users choose between dishes lastly remember to take into consideration what your peers said to you in class the color palette can be darker the list of items should be in alphabetical order unless filtered the word filter should be visible and make clickable links more buttonlike i think your development plan can be slightly improved by making the tasks more specific overall great job,175,,,,
good job this week i like where the app is headed and how the tasks from the datajson is related to your app x some notes definitely keep the nielsens heuristic in mind as you move forward such as consistency aesthetic and minimalist design error prevention etc in the menu notifications is denoted as an icon while the other links are denoted by text keep it consistent consistency speaking of the notification icon i am not sure what it was at the beginning it looks really small and ambiguous match between real world and system app seems text heavy aesthetic and minimalist design and as i mentioned in class perhaps cover the description of the task until clicked open still leave the reminder button visible to remove unnecessary text overall i like the unique implementations but make sure they are fully implemented for user testing as mentioned in your assignment a unique interaction is that your app allows you to remind members of your group but your app seems to lack a way to add members to your group is this something you want toshould implement,186,,,,
a3 feedback beautiful submission so colofrul and thorough explanation of your he i noticed this statement under recognize diagnose and recover from errors these are paper prototypes you cant do this with paper prototypes how is it even possible to answer your question imagine the app had a log in page and i forgot to include my email one popular way to implement a clear error message to help me recognize diagnose and recover from this error is to include a red asterisk on the email field as a way to tell me to correctly fill in this field to include this in a paper prototype you can add another screen that has this error message going forward this idea of providing an organized and easy way for housemates to implement house rules is interesting it perfectly illustrates what the issues are that households may have billing and chores to better your app further try performing a competitive analysis with your app features and existing apps such as your billing feature with venmo another note your app seems to have a lot of features keep in mind the time limit you will have and prioritize which features are more important to implement and which ones should be left to wizard of ozing,212,,,,
organization of the topics could be made more intuitive and the app itself should be better structured to highlight the main functionality of that page topics and discussions should be separated therefore the home page should only display topics and when you click the topic there you can show all the commentsdiscussions that people are having combining them together on one page can overwhelm your users moving forward make sure to add in more messages to inform your users what they did if user created a topic notify the user that they created a new topic this will ensure that the visibility of the system is clear to the user heuristic make sure that each screen has the name of your app as well as the name of the current page that the user is on keep the back buttons consistent some back buttons have labels while others dont another heuristic speaking of back buttons what is the purpose of the back button on the home page the user should not think that they are not in the home page and a back button can be confusing unless it serves a reasonable purpose i would remove the back button on the home page over all good job cant wait to see your progress next week,215,,,,
good job this week i think the app has potential as the unique features mentioned in your assignment sound really cool and i believe that are something your users are interested in some tips on how to brush up your app i think these unique features should be more visible as a scientist i want to upload projects instead of allowing users to easily upload a project they must view my projects to upload a project even though this page should have an upload button i noticed that i was having difficulty figuring out that i had to go that page first to upload a project perhaps have a readily button that allows me to upload project in one click moving forward make sure that your unique functions are completely implemented or done through wizard of oz also make sure that the buttons are doing what they expect to do i noticed that when i try to click the logo which should take me back to home page the article on the homepage which should show me the whole article and the pagination at the bottom of the home page does not seem to be fully implemented i also noticed that the user account has a lot of edit options perhaps have a universal edit option to make the profile page less cluttered nielsens heuristics minimalist design,227,,,,
