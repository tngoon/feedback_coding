594,Is the inch scale really a good interace to show 360 degree renderings of a map?,16,,,
569,i would avoid using the tags test because that will be difficult to quantifiably measure accurately,16,,,
648,nicely done reduce the clutter a bit and this can be a great way to see remaining food,18,,,
168,try not to mention all relatedsimilar interactions,7,,,
627,you havent included the names of the people on the team you whose prototype you were evaluating,17,,,

511,this appears to be a combination of the 2nd3rd storyboards with a more elaborate situation,15,,,
45,nice interactive wireframe,3,,,
302,gameplay not too functional and account options not functional yet,10,,,

233,cant find where the json files are rendered,8,,,
367,what happens when the user wants to create a custom filter,11,,,

32,Clean format,2,,,
91,the fidelity could be better,5,,,
552,You should a specific task for the persona to accomplish instead of introducing the interface.,15,,,

337,Well done visual design! I like the sparseness of it,10,,,
316,i wish there was a way to findcreate a household,10,,,
840,make sure that these are incorporated in the development plan also note the rubric for a8 especially to fix any aesthetic details,22,,,
333,I would like to have the slides a little bigger.,10,,,
183,application to studio brief not explicitly mentioned,7,,,
221,you could have included sketches if not pictures,8,,,
342,ps make sure to select all relevant pages in the pdf,11,,,

558,the select xxx component views state change is very subtle upon users clicking on each item,16,,,
27,great pictures,2,,,
236,Good explaination of the program and its functions,8,,,
712,it is unclear how to add a teammate or the specific instructions for what to do on the mission,19,,,

300,i see undefined in the badges on the home page,10,,,
339,try to have more balanced code contributions from each of you,11,,,
49,no pov found,3,,,
35,Great job,2,,,
343,its nice that you begin with some information about your subjects,11,,,
162,"Layed out perfectly, great work !",6,,,
211,tasks need to be more specific and actionable,8,,,
567,your league pictures do not show the person in question which diminishes from examining the users,16,,,

564,great job if not for the bug with the back button youd have gotten more points,16,,,
271,let me know if you attended some other studio,9,,,
660,the user needs were redundant and the point of view provided a solution overall good job at needfinding,18,,,
139,interpretations of potential results not provided,6,,,
724,your second sentence is a bit too descriptive in that you tell the user to click a specific icon,19,,,
673,the 1st and 3rd storyboards a little too vague to be able to come up with prototype ideas,18,,,
425,could be polished more but as of now its fine to be presented,13,,,
634,I think that the sketches could be better used to communicate clearly the benfits of your idea.,17,,,
131,video feedback nice video very straightforward,6,,,
701,"When the button turns green or red, the text should change to reflect the status such as ""calling""",18,,,
