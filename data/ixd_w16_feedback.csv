18,1,"The questions for the video don't need to be as long, but should be on separate topics. Both your questions were about 1 particular example from the videos. ",29
19,1,Prototype: could be a little bit more telling and expanded as something a partner can interact with.,18

35,1,I don't see your video questions. Let me know if they're attached to your physical submissions.,17
36,1,Great job! Try to brainstorm more ideas and connect them more with your interview.,14
37,1,Prototype and sketch should be separate,6
38,1,good ideas from thorough ideation and iteration. interview really tells a story.,12
39,1,Well done!,3

44,1,Well done!,3
45,1,Would be interesting to see how discovery via emotion plays a role in the future,16
46,1,great work,2
47,1,Well done! Just missing video questions.,6
48,1,Interview questions could have been more general.,7
49,1,"Overall good. Could have Looking for 2 questions, not a question and a comment. Was looking for a more fleshed out prototype.",22

51,1,nice job,2
52,1,ensure you complete entire assignment -- no prototypes present.,9
53,1,Brainstorming: focus on generating a diverse set of concepts rather than worrying too much about laying out the details of few potential solutions.,23
54,1,"Well done! Interesting approach with a more specific problem that if solved, can lead to better experiences overall for Freshman. ",21
55,1,"directions were to fill out worksheet packet twice. despite this, your work is really well done. questions also missing.",19
56,1,treated sketch as prototype,4
57,1,Well done! Just missing video questions.,6
58,1,Well done! Just missing video questions.,6
59,1,"appreciate the humor, but use that effort for going deeper. good job, regardless.",13
60,1,I liked your prototype,4
61,1,Brainstorming: should focus more on generating more diverse concepts. Two might not be be spread wide enough to search for those global maxima,23
62,1,nice work -- ensure you complete the entire assignment -- no feedback or video questions.,15
63,1,"Missing the ideas, sketch, prototype, and testing",7
64,1,good work -- would like to see a wider range of ideas during ideation,14
65,1,Brainstorming: you'll want to focus on generating a more diverse set of concepts. The two you had were pretty limited by their similarity.,23
66,1,Prototype: this should be separate from the details. Something that a user testing can interact with and not be pre-informed by complete descriptions/explanations.,24
67,1,Could have dug deeper in the interviews for some better insights.,11
68,1,Dig a little deeper on your Point of View,9
69,1,nice work,3
70,1,Would have liked to see more sketches for the prototype. Video questions should be about subject matter of videos directly.,21
71,1,questions? i like the price center redesign idea.,8
72,1,No actual questions in the video questions!,7
73,1,Your prototype looks more connected to the studio brief than the interview on the freshman experience.,17
74,1,please use provided materials as they scaffold the design thinking process accordingly,12
75,1,great work,2
76,1,The interest based dorms solution could be fleshed out a bit more - what differentiates it from the traditional matching survey? Prototype is incomplete,24
77,1,"ideate more, kinda fixated",4
78,1,great work,2
79,1,Well done!,3
80,1,"As a follow up, can you think about the downsides to designing such a general purpose app/program? With a lot of users, it would be attractive and work well. What might you encounter when trying to get the initial batch of users?",42
81,1,A lot of this doesn't seem very well connected to a *Freshman* experience.,13
82,1,Brainstorming: focus on a larger number of diverse concepts (brainSTORM),10
83,1,"Prototype: for an application, should be something that a user testing would be interacting with",15
84,1,ensure you're completing the entire assignment -- no video questions or prototypes,12
85,1,"Brainstorming: focus more on generating a diverse set of concepts, rather than multiple deeper details on a single potential solution",20
86,1,Missing questions.,2
87,1,nice work -- ensure you complete the full assignment e.g. video questions,12
88,1,Well done!,2
89,1,"Prototype could be more complete to help simulate the experience with a partner to receive feedback. In line with that, want to avoid explicit floating labeling of what things do on a prototype. ",34
90,1,great work,2
91,1,Well done!,2
92,1,"I like your concept of an application of doing matching work, but ultimately giving the last iteration of selection to the user. There can be many benefits to this.",29
93,1,The prototype is a little lacking in terms of giving a user that is testing a interactive experience to work with. Perhaps a little more integration with the email sent out. Is the video embedded? Is it a separate page?,40
94,1,"Also something to think about: if a system is difficult, when is it better to add more instructions vs. redesign the system?",22
95,1,ensure you're completing entire assignment -- no prototype present.,9
96,1,nice work,2
97,1,"Prototype was good, but no video questions component was added",10
98,1,"sketch could be better, but gave point anyway. video questions?",10
99,1,"Great job on the assignment, but your online submission doesn't contain the first worksheet from class! ",17
100,1,"Prototype could be stronger and more tied to previous ideas. ""Do the preparation for them"" <- how can you design the emails to make the students feel more like this and less like receiving your average spam/university email",38
101,1,good work,2
102,1,Great first interview question.,4
103,1,"great work, but you focused in too much on your prototype, reflected in your use of a computer to make it. remember not to fixate too early on an idea, because a better one might come along and you want to be flexible.",43
104,1,brainstorming and sketching seem to be a strong point.,9
105,1,Dig a little deeper on your point of view.,9
106,1,"Dig deeper on your point of view to help you generate more insightful ideas and prototypes. Also, not having video questions hurt your score.",24
107,1,Only one worksheet submitted.,4
108,1,Brainstormed only on one idea. Quantity is important!,8
109,1,Brainstorming: focus on generating a diverse set of concepts (not just one),12
110,1,good work -- strive for more depth,7
111,1,"Good to see divergent ideas (e.g. not just a similar solution over and over) within each interview, though your in-class and freshman interviews tended toward similar ideas.",27
112,1,"Brainstorming: focus more on generating a diverse set of concepts, rather than all of the details in a single direction/possible solution.",21
113,1,Well done! Just missing video questions.,6
114,1,I like the idea of making the org page more of a portal worth re-visiting instead of a static list.,21
115,1,Good video  questions. I recommend checking out Dan Russel's seminar this spring when it is announced in class because he covers both of these questions really well. Dan's work actually involves observing people in their own homes in an unobtrusive manner to observe as realistic behavior as possible,49
116,1,"Prototype: to get the best results out of testing a prototype, you wouldn't want external labels and explanations of how it works. Otherwise, the feedback given back from the user might be a little too informed.",36
117,1,"I like the very unique approach to interviewing the Freshman though! Most people focus on asking about the negatives, but you chose to inquire more on the positives. ",29
118,1,"Prototype: specific insights from the interview weren't applied too much, seems more like a general catch-all motivation machine. Ajay's case seems to revolve a lot around scores and exams, how might we redesign the experience to maintain motivation for him when that happens?",43
119,1,nice work !,3
120,1,"great work, but you focused in too much on your prototype, reflected in your use of a computer to make it. remember not to fixate too early on an idea, because a better one might come along and you want to be flexible.",43
121,1,Sketch should be separate from the prototype. No questions or reflection component.,12
122,1,nice work!,2
123,1,"Assignment is missing many of the components, such as the interview, sketch, and reflection components.",15
124,1,finally graded. :D,3
125,1,questions missing. please turn them in by 2/26.,8
126,1,Had to take 2 points off because I didn't see your reflection questions for the video!,17
127,1,"Prototype idea was a bit generic, tried to solve all problems and very similar to existing ucsd app, but otherwise good. I didn't see your video questions in the online submission. Let me know if I should check your physical submission. ",42
128,1,questions missing? seem to have strength in ideating and sketching out ideas.,12
129,1,Prototype did not reflect the POV from your interviews. Good insights about the struggles of international students.,17
130,2,Good job!  -1 b/c your talk went long,9
131,2,"""Surprisingly, I found out that two of my participants prefer not to use their phones unless necessary to find their way to places"" -- great",25
132,2,missing third picture,3
133,2,"User needs are *not* application based -- the assignment asked to list the needs, not solutions that could be used to address the needs",24
134,2,Second photo caption does not articulate a breakdown,8
135,2,Make more explicit connection in the observations to how the stories affected the user and caused them to empathize with the original poster. We want more than a factual recounting of your observation.,33
136,2,Needs are expressed too much as specific solutions or features.,10
137,2,"Needs: some redundancies in needs, try to be more critical of what you observed and dig for the deep motivations that cause what you saw",25
138,2,Nice work. Some user *needs* are framed as user *wants* -- these are *very* different things,16
139,2,Good job!,2
140,2,"Observations: would like to see a lot more insightful commentary on the breakdowns/design opportunities for each your observations. It seemed like the main issue you brought up was that they had to use pictures of schedules to sync up. In that activity, where were the pitfalls? What doesn't work about this method? What does work?",55
141,2,"Photo 1: similar to above, it's not clear where the breakdown/design opportunity is in this photo/caption. Having to default to using your phone to engage in the activity is not so much of a breakdown. Where exactly was the pitfall of this interaction?",43
142,2,Needs: some redundancies,4
143,2,"Observations: Remember that you are trying to observe exchange in social situations. Some of your observation discussions don't seem to relate that much to that activity. For example, the breakdown with Colin doesn't really show any slips with him exchanging during his social lunches, only that he eats with the same friends. A better breakdown (for example) might be that Colin fails to talk about interesting topics because he eats with the same people every week. ",77
144,2,Photo 1: The photograph does not really indicate the breakdown/opportunity described in the caption,14
145,2,Needs: A few of these needs aren't as relevant to the activity you observed,14
146,2,Needs: there are a few redundant needs that could be squashed into one,13
147,2,"Interesting problem space, animal companionship definitely has many opportunities to be enhanced with technology. Transferring ownership, temporary or permanent, is definitely an often repeated process that is currently done manually and with varying amounts of success. Be interesting to see how design can help here!",45
148,2,"Clever choice of social media medium to reach more diverse participants and also have some data automatically logged for you. Interesting stuff to think about. When being connected to so many people, how can we selectively exchange personal thoughts while still being efficient?",43
149,2,"Needs: Some needs are redundant. Kyra connecting to people[known/less known] spontaneously to talk to, Vivian having a less distracting social media, etc. ",23
150,2,Was looking for a few more photos highlighting breakdowns.,9
151,2,"Nice work -- it could also be interesting to interview someone on the other side of the event planning equation, e.g. an event goer -- what is their threshold for attending an event?",33
152,2,Photo captions do not articulate breakdowns,6
153,2,be more clear about your breakdowns and opportunities,8
154,2,Very thorough! Great job!,4
155,2,Observations: There isn't a very clear description of what particular activity you were observing. The main detail mentioned is only what kinds of questions you asked in the interviews. I would have liked to see more insight on the things observed while you were watching your participants.,48
156,2,Needs: A number of redundancies needs that aren't particularly critical enough to warrant a design project. We want to really think about what was observed and what motivations would drive peoples' actions in the activity you observed.,37
157,2,"Observations: could be more clear on where exactly the breakdowns/design opportunities are. Asking whether or not they would be willing to exchange for food, recipes, and cooking lessons is a leading question and does necessarily give reliable insight on opportunities for design. ",43
158,2,Photo #2: does not have a clear breakdown/design opportunity. Just describes how Dan goes about his routine.,17
159,2,Needs: some redundant needs,4
160,2,"Great work! A couple of your needs are more features than needs. Other than that, great!",16
161,2,"As we discussed, this is a very important and serious topic. That being said, ensure that you are able to fully complete the learning goals of the course within the prope scope -- e.g. these observations are based on your interviewee's observations, where the assignment specifically wanted *you* to conduct the observations. If the grandiose nature of this topic means you will not be able to fully complete the learning goals, I would strive to find ways of scaling down the topic or finding communities in your immediate environment (e.g. refugees coming to/in San Diego) in order to ensure you are reaching the learning goals in this course. Questions? Come to office hours.",113
162,2,Ensure that needs are *not* articulated as solutions or features.,10
163,2,"The observations need to reflect on what the activity on facebook affected each participant. The second observation had this, but the others didn't.",23
164,2,"As a longstanding method of spreading awareness, flyering definitely has room for interesting design improvements. It was good that you observed different aspects of the flyering process, from the conversation to the travel of the physical handout. ",38
165,2,Observations: No description of activity and it's relation to brief,10
166,2,"Needs: A number of needs that you generated do not seem relevant to the activity that you observed, nor the breakdowns that you found. ",25
167,2,"Observations: Commentary here could be more clear on what breakdowns/design opportunities you found while observing activities. You mention a lot of he said/she said, but not much of really detailing particular things that actually happened while you were watching. It can help a lot in these cases to be more specific. As you watched person X perform activity Y, Z happened when they tried to achieve A,B,C. Etc.",68
168,2,Photo 2: No clear demonstration of breakdown/design opportunity,8
169,2,Photo 3: Same thing,4
170,2,Needs: A number of redundancies in needs listed.,9
171,2,"Fantastic job with the organization of your assignment. Most of the breakdowns you observed seemed to revolve around reminders, which does make sense. I would have been interesting to see if there are any parts of the whole exchange that could yield interesting insights. For example, even the decision stage at a restaurant table when people try to organize payments could be interesting. In a longer span, it could also be interesting to see how much people pay each other back in a mutual fashion (would we really need to exchange money all the time if we're always paying for each other?). Of course, not possible with the time scope of this assignment but something interesting to think about!",119
172,2,Needs: Some of the needs were redundant.,7
173,2,Well done! Great job finding a diverse set of participants with meetings involving members with varying levels of commitment. A core problem with many different possible breakdowns.,28
174,2,"Observations: no discussion of what the activity is/relation to brief. In general, missing a lot of substance regarding breakdowns/opportunities for design distilled from observation. Not very clear what exactly is being observed, and what you observed was a breakdown/opportunity. While interviewing is also an important role in needfinding, watching and observing breakdowns (rather than only listening to what they have to say about their problems) is a major part of this assignment. Did the lack of nicely designed signs hinder Alon in his activity? Does Diana make mistakes in ordering because of calorie concerns? These are examples of potential breakdowns that would be important to watch out for.",108
175,2,Needs: some redundancies/lack of relevance in needs.,8
176,2,Your ideas and topic are very interesting! But the sketches submitted demonstrated features or solutions. They should show users in the situation and the breakdowns in that situation.,28
177,2,Very thorough! Your needs were articulated more as features though. Be careful about being too solution-focused in this first step,20
178,2,Nice work -- ensure to not articulate needs as solutions.,10
179,2,"Ensure that you are not articulating needs as solutions or features: e.g. ""Jason needs an App that can help him find activity for him""",24
180,2,Second photo's caption does not express a breakdown,8

182,2,"I like the topic, but wanted to see a more explicit discussion of breakdowns in your notes and photo captions.",20
183,2,well done!,3
184,2,Good job!,2
185,2,Wanted to see a clearer connection to the Quantified brief.,10
186,2,Very thorough. Focus on being a little more concise next time.,12
187,2,"good effort, but shopping is overplayed, and the observations and needs from Andrea are irrelevant to a mobile app solution",20
188,2,Ensure that you are *not* articulating user needs as solutions !,11
189,2,Good job!,2
190,2,"The observations are only factual accounts, and doesn't demonstrate any empathetic reflection on how the usage of instagram affected the participants. Also make the breakdowns explicit.",26
191,2,"A need such as ""Students need to have an easy usage application, not too complicated to learn"" is too generic to offer any design opportunities.",25
192,2,"There were no explicit description on what breakdowns you saw in the observations. To relate to the brief, reflect on what kind of emotions the stories each participant found made them feel.",32
193,2,Great job focusing on user needs! The 1st photo didn't demonstrate much of a breakdown. May have been better to show what was on his screen to show that he doesn't use reminders or calendars,35
194,2,"As we discussed in class, you should not ask people to describe how they think someone in New York does something. Instead, you want your interviewee to reflect on what they are an expert of: e.g. their own experiences. While it's great that you're reaching out to TAs to get feedback, ensure you are then *implementing* that feedback in your work.",61
195,2,Photo 1: doesn't really cover the breakdown/design opportunities you observed with this participant,13
196,2,"Overall, I think it was great that you covered multiple avenues through which people decide to make book purchases. Most people will simply jump on the conclusion that there should be a catch-all app that everyone can use and viola, textbook exchange solved. However, as you have observed, it is important to consider design opportunities everywhere, in bookstores, social media, online marketplaces, etc. ",64
197,2,not enough user needs; user needs are too similar and rephrased for different users,14
198,2,"Good work -- seems as if there are interesting design opportunities about scheduling, especially our reluctance to commit e.g. ""maybe syndrome"" Looking forward to learning more about this in future assignments",31
199,2,"some needs not relevant to brief, could be more insightful",10

204,2,Good observations. I enjoyed how diverse the observed people were.,10
205,2,"The user needs had a few too many feature descriptions, that were also duplicates. The crux of the issue seems to be to marry the physical interactivity a reader can have with a physical form with the advantageous features that a virtual form delivers.",44
206,2,"The idea that in an instructor-student interaction, stories and feelings are being shared is interesting.",15
207,2,"However, this was not demonstrated in the observations, or their description. Specifically, the description from the professor or the TA's perspective was lacking. If they were displaying apathy, explicitly describe that. Also one observation that was specifically on the instructor would help.",42
208,2,No photos given.,3
209,2,"This topic is definitely interesting. But the sketches submitted were sketches of features rather than of breakdowns or design opportunities. Observations were also not comprehensive, and some of the needs were articulated as features.",34
210,2,Be careful not to focus on the solution too much. The needs were very feature-focused when they should be focused on the user's needs outside of technological solutions. Observations also need to be more clearly related to studio brief.,39

212,2,You did great!,3
213,2,"you are focusing on a system-driven design, remember we need the user to input the data manually",17
214,2,First photo didn't demonstrate a breakdown necessarily. Observations and needs need to be more clearly related to studio brief.,19
215,2,I was confused as to how the interviews and observations related to a project idea. The sketches were more solutions rather than breakdowns. I was unclear as to exactly what activity you were observing or interviewing for.,37
216,2,"Observations: some discussion seemed too focused on particular application interfaces from certain vendors. While these can be opportunities for some interface design projects, the variability in this can make it hard to find relevant needs for the activity you are observing.  ",43

218,2,"some needs are too vague, or not insightful",8
219,2,"No clear activity picked, more of an amalgam of various things. While it was still valuable to go into these different activities not knowing exactly what you would find, you want to narrow down your activity in this stage of the design cycle to gain as much insight about a particular activity as you can.",55
220,2,Photo # 3: could have more clarity on the breakdown. Is it just lack of knowledge? Where does this user slip? Has he shown indication of trying to find other musicians? Which part of that along the way give slight to this breakdown?,44
221,2,"Good choices of activities to observe regarding student organizations. Particularly interesting how much memory is involved in activities 1 & 2. From counting votes, to teaching routines, taking care of memory issues is always an opportunity for design in technology. ",41
222,2,Observations: could be a little bit more clear on where breakdowns/opportunities are occurring in some of your observations. Ex. Are there instances where Brian slips while going about the normal routine of correcting differences? Did any mishaps happen when trying to recall routine fro memory?,46

228,2,"Your observations were of college students, but your needs mentioned young kids. Make sure your needs address the population you observed. Some needs were slightly redundant. Your sketches and captions better described the breakdowns than your description of the observations.",40
229,2,"Clear, but the scope of social collaboration can be broadened a bit rather than just only within games.",18
230,2,"I was confused as to what you were observing. The observations did not demonstrate breakdowns that could serve as  design opportunities within the scope of this project. Some of the needs listed were focused on technologies rather than user needs.

236,2,Some of your needs are much too feature oriented as opposed to a need that presents a design opportunity.,19
237,2,The explanation of how each music affected the participants in your observations was great.,14
238,2,"But your photos #1 and #2 were of solutions, not of the observation, breakdown, or design opportunities.",17
239,2,"Great diverse set of observations for this activity. Would have also been interesting to see how the rest of the exchange process goes, rather than the beginning, but I understand the constraints of time. Be careful about restricting insight to much to specific systems like TritonTexty. Can we generalize things a bit more?

I know you say that Jeremy needs to work consistently without feeling tired and pressured, but you don't address the fact that earlier he says that he uses this time pressure as a way to motivate himself to finish his work. It seems like there's more to understand here about why he works the way he does and how his situation might be improved. ",77

351,2,"Very interesting problem space of personal instructors to consider. Some things to think about would be how other professional teaching exchange systems work (instructors for hire from official intuitions). Perhaps one way to increase the reliability on both sides of the tutor and student would be to even just give it a facade of being a professional system, rather than an under the table transaction. Could it be that both parties don't really work as professionally because having the same peer status undermines professional respect? Would be interesting to find out the answer to that. ",96

355,2,"Syncing with people is definitely a problem space that has many opportunities for design improvements and is applicable to many environments. You did well in paying attention to the details of people's interactions with the interfaces they use to perform this exchange. The focus you placed on interface specific issues, though, draws you away from the larger activity, that is, schedule exchange/sync. I would have liked to see more commentary and insight from what you observed that dug deeper into the motivations and context behind those looking to schedule things. There could be a lot more to discover as you shift the lense. How does the type of meetup sought to be schedule affect how people interact in finding a time? How are timing, early preparation, spontaneity, etc. involved in this activity? These are all types of interesting questions that you could pursue to really find some stronger needs.",149
356,2,"Needs: A lot of redundancies and a lot of needs that are very surface level. Based on the discussion I have written above, try to think about what people really need from the activity of schedule exchange, not so much what they really need from current implemented interfaces. ",49
357,2,"Overall, great detail with observations in both the commentary and photos/captions. I think it's a good start to figuring out the needs of this particular activity. It would have been extra helpful to have some more observation on how these people communicated with those who they share the space with, to see what kinds of workarounds they typically engage in.",60
358,2,"Needs: There's a number of redundancies in the needs listed. They could also be a little bit more critical of the activity and what insightful things you observed; dig deeper for core motivations.

Are there needs here that might open up interesting design opportunities?",67
359,2,"Overall, you did a great job with your observations and commentary. This is a great problem space that will undoubtably be relevant for a long time. Good detail on exactly where the pitfalls were for people in this application process. In the scope of this assignment, it makes sense to limit your activity to the scope of one application process, since it would be trivial to try to cover all types of application systems. However, in the future, it may be useful to include some explanation validating the use of one particular process to study the activity as a whole. Again, in the scope of this assignment, not as big of a concern/wasn't required.",114
360,2,"Needs: Some of these needs were redundant and could have been squashed down into fewer. One of the things to watch out for, mostly because of the nature of what you observed, is to not fall too deep into generating too many needs that are interface specific. Remember to take a step back and think about the activity as a whole, the users' experience, their core motivations, and ultimately what they need and how that can be the basis for some interesting design projects. ",85
361,2,Very interesting choice of topic and great diversity in activities chosen. I found that the most insightful observations that you made were in your 3rd section with the natural interative setting between Leo & Mikey where you brought up the design opportunity that learning together is fun. I would have liked to see more of this type of oberservation in your other sections. Often times it's what's done that can speak even louder than what is said.,78

383,2,"Be careful not to focus on the solution too much. The first photo provided was more solution focused than demonstrating a breakdown. Some of the needs listed were also more feature-focused.

384,2,"Your pictures did not make the breakdown/design opportunity clear. Your needs were written as things that the user wants, not needs. Also they were often written as  features - eg ""user wants a confirm alert"", where you should be talking about the underlying need that a confirm alert is trying to address. why does the user want a confirm alert? the need there is to avoid making an error. ",71
385,2,Two of your breakdowns were very general.  They sounded more like a restatement of the challenges of dieting than an example of exactly how a diet goes off course.,31
386,2,The only point you lost was for not clearly demonstrating design opportunities/breakdowns in your submission. Your interviews were written up describing what the people you interviewed said without focusing on the actions they took and your own evaluation of the content of their statements. It's important when doing needfinding to go deeper into what people do by digging deeper into the answers that people give you. In addition to listening.,71

389,2,Missing photos/sketches for each observation. Observations should be more comprehensive and demonstrate a clear user breakdown and should be explicitly linked to the studio brief.

The Tinder bullet might be the closest to addressing this, but still lacks depth in what about this particular matchmaking system inspires you or offers some insightful takeaway. ",55
404,3,POV: Good articulation of strategy and issue of honest communication. Can we condense this a little bit more? Think about if you had only 10-15 seconds to pitch your POV to someone. What would you say? This will be useful to know moving forward.,44

It's not quite clear in storyboard 2 how the engagement of the application affects your user. There seems to be a lot more heavily focused on the problem; there should be a good balance. ",53
406,3,"Overall, I think the idea of provoking honest feedback/criticism between people is a great design problem. Would love to see how this turns out and how you can make it work. The specific market of fashion critique is a great place to start! Appearances are probably something that people think about all the time. ",55
407,3,"Be careful about creating something like ""Tinder for UCSD"" as this has been done over and over again. Your POV included social anxiety, and I think your storyboards and prototypes should more address the social anxiety aspect rather than simply being an app to find ""connections"" or friends. Think of some other game elements that you might be able to incorporate into a social app like this. ",68
408,3,"POV: The core user need can be clearer in this point of view. Just learning described as a daunting task, nor pointing out the potential useful need of peer experts is quite concretely demonstrating a user need. ",38
409,3,"Inspiration: A lot of fantastic discussion on particular interface features and interactive elements. Would like to see some more commentary on some higher level inspiration related to your POV. On your own time, spend a few thinking about some other applications/systems that might inspire you in that area. ",49
410,3,"Prototypes: For the scans, you should show some steps indicating a flow that takes a user through the application. Otherwise, someone looking would not be able to distill the proper interactions from the prototype and create a functional application. ",40
411,3,"In general, it's also a little difficult to distill the critical high-level design differences between the two prototypes. They both seem pretty centered around a lookup of people teaching certain subjects, and the ability to initiate some conversation. Considering some different designs to address your POV can greatly help with the iterative process. Try to spend some time thinking about on your own time. This will also help you figure out exactly what core feature makes your final app what it is.",82

Solution 2 with the voting and finality of an eventual locked-in decision could be an interesting direction, especially with the inclusion of the ""random"" option for those who don't actually care in the decision of where to eat. I would spend some time thinking about, or even better yet observing situations when people are deciding where to eat. Could it be that there are just a few in the party that guide the discussion and the rest not caring? If so, what part of this exchange do you want to enhance with technology? Help the lead deciders decide faster? Let those who care less or feel like their opinion doesn't matter contribute anyway in light of fairness?  Stuff to think about.

If they___re not able to access a charity they want to donate to through your app, they might also be inclined to give up. Can they set monetary goals for particular charities? Is money their only interaction with these charities, or at least the only one that you want to support. All good questions to consider. Second idea is simple but I like it.

As discussed in studio, thinking about what other partial information to show/prioritize on the tutor tiles can aid in the experience. Depending on how many categories you end up having, and how you choose to organize that, it may not be as important to have the first screen be one with category tiles. One piece of flow that I think will also be important to think about soon is how a teacher will manager the things they listed to teach, especially if it's in multiple categories (unless you want to restrict that). I have a feeling that teachers are bound to want to edit things as their schedules move around. The other big piece is how appointments will be handled, but you also have that on your list of todos.

For the filter/search, I think it can still be de-confused a little bit more. With a field for text and a dropdown for certain categories, it's not immediately clear how the flow is supposed to work there (my current mental model things that they should be separate?). If that's true, you might want to physically decouple the filter dropdown from the search. I assume the dropdown is to reorder the information that is displayed, and the search input is to drill down to more specific information. On the same line, it looks like they are supposed to be used in conjunction before hitting the search icon. ",126
904,5,"Plan: May want to work on breaking down what the shopping cart page should contain, especially core interactions. Sometimes it's also best to have tasks that have strong measurability in success.

Outside constraints may also be handy placed under each respective week so they are visible when looking at that week's plan. Otherwise, keep it up with the specific tasks. Immediately actionable is a good rule of thumb. ",99
905,5,"App: OCDing on that + not being centered in the circle. Filter/search commented on in HE changes section. Still a little unclear what the second magnifying glass is supposed to do in the navigation portion. Partial information on the tiles, as discussed in studio will probably be useful to think about as well. Part of this information that I think could be useful to show would be whether or not the food item is ""freshly cooked"" or ""leftover from all my groceries and I just want to get rid of it."" In general, distinguishing items in those two categories is something to discuss with the team. As a user, those are probably the two courts I would fall under when looking for food to buy/sell. Along with that, how will you cater differently to those trying to sell as more a chef person, and those trying to sell as more of a grocery store person (poorly worded, but I hope the idea of what I'm getting it kind of makes sense, feel free to ping me if it's incomprehensible). Lastly, for listings, it's sometimes a good interface decision to let people preview their posts. Facebook does this really nicely by combining the input gathering field in a similar structure that the post would be in, effectively ""previewing"" it as the user fills things out. Could be something to consider! Overall good progress so far.  ",236

As a note, when you list out the HE violations it may be useful to list things like which heuristic and what the violation actually was just as a reminder. Sometimes you might forget where things stemmed from if you just have a feature list. As you move forward, definitely be sure to test out mental models for the plans you have for communication -- especially during and after transaction. I think just leaving it all to email can definitely work, as long as it's organized right. One of the crux points may be determining when in the process (since it's taken offline - in the sense of your app when it moves to third party email - at some point) someone's listing is considered rented out. It might be that we just let the owner of the item self-moderate and edit the listing when the transaction is carried out -- or maybe not, can we trust the user?",180
913,5,"Development Plan: Tasks are too big/high-level! A good rule to go by would be tasks that are immediately actionable. More specific is better.

Had trouble viewing parts of the app, so could not really test the navigation, but as I recall from class, much of the navigation was there, though pages still needed to be fleshed out and the surveys were pretty minimal at this point.

922,5,"I was a little unclear on what changes you planned to make and which you had made already. Also, your Assignment Dashboard felt more like a skeleton than a fully fleshed out page. However, as discussed in studio, I am more concerned that you think deeply about how to motivate and encourage students, rather than just provide a central place for them to track grades. Focus on your user needs and don't get too sucked into coding a feature that does not directly address them (though you should spend significant time developing this week).",94
923,5,more detail in the revisit brief paragraph. more functionality for the two screens. good skeleton tho.,16
924,5,"Prototype: Navigation is clean and mostly there so good job on that. I also like that the functionality is simple and not too cluttered. One thing is that it is still unclear what your POV is from looking at the app. You want your app to stand out from other fitness apps (MyFitnessPal, Fitbit, etc.). For example, one thing lacking from Fitbit is that when not wearing a Fitbit or when not competing with friends, users often aren't as motivated to exercise because it isn't being monitored. Think about how you app can improve upon that intrinsic motivation problem. ",100
925,5,"HE Changes: Do not see strong evidence that some of these changes were implemented in the app so far. In fact, change #11 is actually still pretty present -> as a user it looks like I can click the schools on the front page, but nothing happens. Technically you implemented change #13 but that's not quite an important change to address the evaluations at this moment. Would have liked to see things like #3, #11, etc. At least some simple interface changes that would have a large impact on usability. ",91
926,5,Plan: Good detail on the plan -- categorizing with the title column is very useful! Keep going for listing immediately actionable tasks. Love that notes include resources for where to start digging for information related to the tasks.,39
927,5,"App:  The current navigational skeleton is confusing. From the first page, as mentioned earlier, it is already odd that the user is unable to click through any of the colleges listed. After drilling down into a college, the app navigation completely chances as a header and footer are added. Header actions don't link to any skeleton pages. Footer works, but again, inconsistent with earlier stages of the application. You'll want to work on making this all consistent as soon as possible, as well as making sure things that users expect to happen when clicking, do happen as often as possible. From studio, also consider what kinds of persistent, user-specific information will be important for both high school users and college users. When I log on and have been using this app before to set up appointments, what will I want to see to check up on those? What will be most important to me to make all this exchange as smooth as possible?",164
928,5,"Revisit: Explanation of relation to brief is there, but discussion of concrete iterations through the design cycle is very, very generic. The first half of the paragraph could be applied to every project and not give too much insight into what specifically happened as the team worked through this first half of the quarter.

929,5,"Plan: Development Plan: Tasks are too big/high-level! A good rule to go by would be tasks that are immediately actionable. More specific is better. For example, two additional pages -> there's a lot of overhead to be decided before you can actually act on this item. Which two pages? What should be on them? Key links after navigation -> what key links? What is the skeleton? Work on changing this for future tasks in the development plan.",77
930,5,"Revisit: Good discussion here about how you iterated from initial idea conception. Making the group experience fun and having a final judge can definitely be useful for facilitating exchange. One thing you'll definitely have to consider is the cost of employing this ""final judge,"" especially if you are a wishy washy rascal that doesn't care to take part in deciding. You'll want to lower this cost as much as possible. One way to go about this is to take advantage of repetition. People with this problem may or may not (up to you to find out/decide on this) go out and eat often. How can we leverage this, especially if it's same/similar groups of people going out repeatedly? Can we give some extra value/incentive to those who use this over and over again (which ideally is true, if it is a fun and easy final judge)?",146
931,5,"App: In terms of interface, really work on making actions obvious to users. Currently, it's really hard to tell what you should be clicking (tapping), and what to expect from when you do click things. Remember to use metaphors from real life. If you want a button, make it look like a button. Or, if you want larger tiles, make them look like larger tiles that can be clicked. When setting restrictions, considering that categories will be limited by what your system registers in its filter system, maybe you should just provide all the options to restrict, and just let users tap through things they don't want, instead of having them type out a listing manually. Just a consideration. Lastly, in relation to my earlier comments on the brief revisitation, you might want to think about having a way to save groups and keep them persistent. This a great way to not only make it easier to use the app repeatedly, but also to facilitate repeated exchange between groups of friends. This can be a great encouraging factor to hop on the app and rile up your pals to go eat. ",192
932,5,"HE Changes: Very thorough listing of HE violations and changes to address them! Also nice organization with categorizing which changes you've already done and which are in progress. Not sure where 'Make the Login page the first page' is occurring, might have been an outdated change?",46
933,5,"Plan: Would like to see a little bit more specificity in tasks. Focus on having things that are immediately actionable. For example, 'Use HE to make changes to HS, ADP, and Log' is a pretty big task assigned to the entire group. That requires a pretty big overhead in deciding who at what moment does what in particular.   I would move the stretch goes into separate feature tasks so they are easier to keep track of and more modular in terms of who to assign to and what to do etc. Missing time estimates, makes it hard to account for potential scheduling obstacles. ",106
934,5,"App: Good use of very obvious buttons and action colors (blue for link!) to show what should be clickable and what is not. In terms of mental models, that part of what a user should expect is nice and straightforward. Interface wise, the flow is not quite clear in how navigating through as a guest and as a user is supposed to differ. Currently it seems like just a hodgepodge of both mashed into the main screen. Key interaction flow that will want to be worked on next will be what happens after a user creates an event and, on the flip, what happens after a user joins an event. How will that part of the exchange be handled to make sure the end goal for these users is met? Higher-level comments below.",133
935,5,"Revisit: In terms of idea/app identity, one thing I would like to see more clarity on in the future is the target audience. I think when a lot of people hear 'events' it seems to cater more to the larger organized events put together for whoever wants to drop by -- not much of a limited allowance on attendees. It seems though that your app is more geared toward just regular people looking to start an activity but are lacking a few buddies to kick things off. If that is so, how can we bring out this core feature of the app? Or maybe you want to appeal to both kinds of things. At this point, it's not too immediately obvious so figuring out how to push whatever identity out will be pretty important. ",135
936,5,Plan: May be useful to add another column for page to organize grouped subtasks (if you want to organize by page). Might be easier to visualize overall development structure that way.,33
937,5,"App: Good progress so far. Would have been better to implement an additional screen that wasn't just the sign-up page. I wouldn't really consider that page to be much of a main functional page so it doesn't aid too much in understanding the core interaction flow of the application. From studio, I actually do like the full screen map, but also agree with some of the feedback that it may be good to move the bottoms and hero title into a specific header and footer overlaid on top of the full screen map, just to give it more of a separated interface feel. Also noted in studio, think a bit about the core functionality of the find explorers option, and how you want to integrate that into the core of your app if you do end up using it. Another part of the interaction to consider is what users will do if they are not sure exactly where they want to explore, but still want to follow where their friends go. I think close places would probably handle that well for locations that are near, but what about far? Probably not a huge priority item but something to to think about. There will probably be more to discuss as the flow of location -> listing of places becomes more fleshed out. ",222
938,5,Revisit: Missing discussion of concrete changes over time with design tools learned thus far. I like the leveraging of already made networks to gain more catered 'reviews'/indicators of where to go.,32
939,5,HE Changes: Good work! Might be useful to condense all of these changes into a super concise list for ease of reference as you progress through development in the next few weeks.,32
940,5,"Plan: Focus on having more specific tasks. A good rule of thumb to go by is immediately actionable. You seem to have a lot of broad tasks that can definitely be broken down.  A lot of your main pages are just listed as one single item, but there are probably multiple elements that are involved in those pages. You can either be more specific in the task or break them down into subtasks. Otherwise, the task becomes a multilayer of figuring out what to do, and then actually doing it (not immediately actionable). ",95
941,5,"App: Good progress so far! To review some notes from studio, think about grouping all the ""Join"" portions of flow separately from all the ""Create"" portions of flow on the first screen. Clicking the name of the app in the menu to exit and log out of the current meeting session is not very intuitive, might as well just have a ""leave"" button or something similar. Things to think about moving forward - how will the moderator view differ from the user view? What other partial information may be useful to show on the listed pollings? Input validation/input display. Highly encourage if you haven't already to go talk to some student orgs that do a lot of polling/voting (student government ones are a great target group) and watch a meeting to see what might be best for facilitating this exchange. Would be really awesome to see this actually being used @ some meetings on campus one day. ",158

A couple suggestions: The scrolling mission log is overwhelming. Might be useful to collapse them and make them individually expandable. The mission frequency circles were misaligned when resized to mobile so it was a bit confusing to know which frequency is chosen. When I hit enter after entering a subtask, I was expecting to be able to create another subtask but was sent straight into my mission even though I hadn't finished writing out my tasks.

A minor suggestion would be to have a home page so separated from the home page so that when you click on ""WeFit"" you go to a home screen rather than your profile.

988,5,"Your development plan items need to be immediately actionable. e.g. ""logo"" is not an immediately actionable item; ""Draw 5 candidate sketches for logo."" makes clear what the necessary action is.

989,5,"Your idea regarding anonymity and collaboration needs to be explored/explained further, as very often anonymity actually drives away empathy.",19
990,5,"HE Changes: Good job. I'm particularly interested to see how the twitter follower model will turn out - really good to think about how other models work to decide on how to build your own. You're probably already thinking about these, but don't forget to also consider some of the smaller HE evaluations like wording, flow with actions, etc. ",60
991,5,"Plan: Pretty solid plan. Keep working with specific, immediately actionable tasks. Moving forward it might actually be useful to add another column that categorizes which page(s) the work is to be done on since it appears you're already making that distinction in all the tasks. I like that you have tasks outside of just development, like finding design inspirations. ",60
992,5,"App: Overall good process so far. As noted in studio, the main interface considerations I would give for the first functional page with the feed would be the coupling of ""Ask"" and ""Undecided."" Currently, they are grouped, but ""Ask"" is more of an action event that leads to creation while ""Undecided"" is more of a navigational/filter button. Perhaps you may want to decouple this and have ""Ask"" create be a separate interface element, and let the bottom tray be entirely for navigation throughout the content that is already available. Other things to think about: partial information display on the question cards (I see this start to form on your ""Undecided"" page, but there's a lot going on in there with different colors and symbols and you may want to narrow down to a few easy to interpret indicators of the status of a question), what determines when a question is officially decided. I like the promise of having the ""Undecided"" section of the feed. For a little bonus incentive, would be cool to have something telling users they are awesome when the ""Undecided"" section is empty. I've seen that employed in some apps and thought it was really fun and encouraging to go answer things. ",206
993,5,Revisit: Nice discussion about reaching the two main target audiences on both sides of the exchange. These two groups will be very important to always keep in mind as the app is worked on.,35
994,5,"Plan: A good amount of specific steps. Be careful with some of the tasks; you want them to be as immediately actionable as possible.  For example, develop movement between screens of the app, could be more specific in what that means. Otherwise, it would require extra mini tasks beforehand to figure out what that movement means, before actually doing the implementation.  Same goes for creating skeleton pages for pages we might need - can we be more specific here?",81
995,5,"App: One huge piece of the skeleton and flow that I don't quite see is organization pages. I imagine organizations would have some info to be able to be drilled into via list of orgs and maybe even in your profile for orgs that you've matched into. How is that part of the app going to be navigated to and fro? Seems important especially if a big part of your app is to connect people to orgs for interaction, not just matching. Some notes from studio: feedback on yes && feedback on no, weird button names after adding something to your interests, system status on how many orgs you need to cycle through. ",114
996,5,"Revisit: Would have liked to see more discussion of concrete insight/changes throughout iteration in the design cycle. A lot of this seems like fluff that isn't too specific to your team's experience working through to this current point -> what in needfinding, HE, and prototyping, led you to making a better app? Your initial idea was matching a person to a club. Right now the model also looks like the main actions are to match someone up or view a list. What is it in your idea now that illustrates the new experience you are hoping to design? You mention interacting and connecting with organizations, but that's still very vague. ",111
997,5,Plan: Nice plan! Keep working with immediately actionable tasks.,10
998,5,"App: Good progress so far. As noted in studio, I like how to tested with different amounts of user input -- keep that up + think about input validation/displaying etc.! ",31
999,5,Some thoughts: - Work with the right most icon (star) a bit -- may not represent what a user would expect it to represent.,25
1000,5,How would you like a user to proceed if they have a category in mind to browse into?,19
1001,5,"- If I post things, what's the quickest way for me to jump to those posts or display those posts/their results?",21
1002,5,"Random thought -- when searching for feedback on fashion, will people ever want to have multiple photos/angled grouped in a single post? If that were the case, would you want to allow for this but place a limit on how many? Could be interesting to consider. ",48
1003,5,HE Changes: Interesting dialogue approach with the HE evaluations; fun to read! Might be useful later to condense this into a concise list just so it's easier to keep track of for changes in the future.,37
1004,5,"Plan: The main thing I would work on for your development plan is to have more specific tasks. A good rule of thumb to go by is immediately actionable. You want to avoid leaving tasks largely open ended like Create ""X"" page. There's a lot that can happen on a page! One way to work around this is to group several smaller tasks under one page. That way, it's all organized but the team and anyone reading the plan also has a good idea of what immediately actionable items need to be done. Tasks like you have toward the end of week 6 are better. ",106
1005,5,"App: Good progress with straightforward navigation flow. Navigation at the top of the screen could probably be condensed (you probably already have this in mind) to not take up 1/3rd of the screen. As discussed in studio, be sure you have plans for how to validate && display all kinds of user input. On the home screen, you'll want to distinguish favrs that you need to do, and that others need to do for you. One higher-level consideration that I think is important is the overall model of requesting favrs. Currently it seems like you must request one from a specific person. I originally thought the idea of the app was to sent out an SOS into the world when you need a favor done, and someone interested picks it up. Is that an element of the app that the team decided to remove? If so, then the focus of this app will definitely more be on the managing favrs side of things, rather than the connecting people with favrs approach. Whichever model you decide to run with, just make sure you think about what the core of the app will be for the target audience.",196
1006,6,competitive analysis could be more convincing. i hope you try to distinguish yourself more. add more detail to dev plan. Ola and Paulo need to start pulling more weight.,29
1007,6,great competitive analysis. didn't distribute work to kaitlin? pre-assign the tasks. more detail with tasks.,15
1008,6,Great progress so far! Definitely on a good pace.,10
1009,6,"Don't have too many major comments on high-level things. Maybe the largest scope consideration would be any power that the owner of the meeting has. Can they kick people, can they restrict who can ask questions/make polls, etc. Might be useful to look into and it's some set of features I might actually want if I were to use this app in a meeting / lecture etc. The only other changes I have in mind right now is what we talked about in office hours about the navigation indicators, kind of like breadcrumbs, that tell you where exactly in the app you are (for example, on the page where it shows all the polls, the top header can just say ""Polls""). Buttons can be bigger, since it is for mobile. ",131
1010,6,"Competitive analysis: Hard to tell from the description what the actual space of the competing market is. What are the other products doing?  The reason why this is important is because one of the best ways to understand the advantage of your product is to understand the rest of the solutions in the same market space. Additionally, really considering the space helps bring out who exactly you would be competing with. If being catered to outdoor gear is what you are going for, perhaps a huge competing solution is simply outdoor gear rental stores. In that case, being catered to outdoor gear is not really the competitive advantage that you want to focus on. etc.  ",118
1011,6,"Interaction flow: Main navigational dead-end issue right now is with your menu not being functionally implemented yet. Technically you can 'back' enough times to get to another point but a user shouldn't have to do that - most blocking thing right now in terms of flow!  Other than that, the other major consideration I would give to flow is with the 'renting out your gear' path that we talked about in studio. There can definitely be a more condensed while still guided (if that's what you want to go for) way to request input for renting out some gear.",100
1012,6,"App things: Renaming rent out vs. rent. Back vs. menu icon. The amount of space that the header takes up varies at different points in the app, not really that big of an issue but something I noticed. I think everything is looking pretty solid and worked out with what you have so far. Simple and usable. Really the next thing to focus on is the exchange point past viewing and listing items to be exchanged. Once that's thought out and handled you should have a MVP (minimum viable product) ready for some more intensive testing! Totally fine to not do all the kinds of gear, but would be cool to see at least one other listing page fleshed out besides tents, since having content catered to specific item was one of the nice features you had described for your app. As we get closer to the end, think about ways to highlight the best parts of your app; things that make it really unique! ",166
1013,6,Supporting info: Haha nice self destructing task message.,8
1014,6,"Competitive Analysis: Good distinction from Yelp, but I'm not sure they are the *best* fit for covering similar solutions in the same market. Your app is based on utilizing media to explore where other people have explored. For Yelp, that's a very secondary at best function. Can you find any other apps that focus on the idea of friend check-ins? ",61
1015,6,"Interaction flow: ""Find Explorers"" page primary functionality not quite clear and usable at the moment. ",16
1016,6,"Data: It's a start for data usage, but as of turn-in pretty sparse usage. Could you have better mocked up the find explorers page with some JSON data?",28
1017,6,Dev plan: The creep block items probably could have been budged better toward finishing the primary functionality of all pages (namely find explorers),23
1018,6,"Misc app stuff: I think flow wise, because of how simple the app is, most of that is pretty in order. It's a lot of functionality work now, especially since you have a decent amount of dependence on some third party applications. Make sure you can find a way to get that done, and if it's too complicated, ensure that you have a back-up plan for wizard of ozing it. By the end of this week, you want essentially a minimum viable product that can successfully let your user find their next adventure so you can get the best results out of testing. Surprise me is pretty straight forward, so I would put a good amount of effort into getting at least one of 'Find Explorers' or the 'Map' working so that a real flow exists (ideally the map, since it seems like the main feature). ",147
1019,6,"great job--be sure to update the dev plan to slowly include tasks for weeks 8-10 as well. Add your own stretch goals, if any.",24
1020,6,"App: Submit button on home page is missing though the functionality is there. One thing that hasn't yet been fleshed out is what happens when the user starts cooking? How can the user unlock more tastebuddies?    Instead of having the ""chef"" icon on your recipes, maybe just allow the user to see the recipe by simply clicking on the image. This would seem to be more intuitive. The bookmarked pages tab doesn't lead anywhere. Should at least lead to a placeholder page.",85
1021,6,Competitive analysis: Your analysis doesn't specifically mention any of your competitors. You should include specific apps that are similar to yours and compare them explicitly to show why yours is different or better.,34
1022,6,"App: There is a lot of text on each of the pages and a lot of scrolling. You may want to think of ways to either shorten the text or make it easier to navigate through the text. Having the ""Learn more"" and ""Let's get started"" buttons in two different places are a bit redundant and confusing. A better way to link these two would be to have a single button to get started and a link to the ""learn more"" underneath it. It is also unclear what the levels are. When ""Level 1: Stiffy"" appears on the page, I was unaware of what this meant.",106
1023,6,Competitive analysis: 2 of the 3 apps you mentioned were geared to children. You should touch upon more apps that are geared towards your target demographic (like the Chore Wars app I linked to you in Piazza).,37
1024,6," App: I liked the flipping card portion, great functionality. The tutorial page doesn't lead anywhere. You should have it lead to some placeholder page at least. Good functionality and navigation otherwise. The symbol for your House Settings makes it seem like this would be the home page even though it isn't. You may want to change that to have a more generic settings symbol. I think you might also want to emphasize the house-splitting aspect of this app and really emphasize the trading card system of it as this is the major differentiation between your app and others that may be similar.",103
1025,6,Github URL didn't work. Couldn't give points for JSON data without this info. Task for testing wasn't very detailed or concrete. A better task would be to ask user to complete a chore and verify it.,36
1026,6,Competitive analysis: No comparison to other apps on the market. You should explicitly state what other types of workout apps are doing and why yours is different or better.,30
1027,6,Task: 2-sentence task isn't really a concrete task for users to do. Instead it describes what the app can do.,21
1028,6,Competitive analysis: could go more in-depth into how the interactions of your app make yours better than the existing apps. The current competitive analysis doesn't really  dive into how your features differ from other apps.,37
1029,6,"App: I think the game elements still need to be better fleshed out., and the POV is still not very clear. Good visual design and simple navigation. ",28
1030,6,Task: the task given is not very concrete. Should be very specific as to what user should do.,19
1031,6,"App: Good, simple navigation. On the mobile version, the potato is blocking a portion of the ""add task"" button, which might cause issues for the user trying to find it. It is also not as clear as to what the Plus button means. It is still unclear that the challenges part is the main functionality of the app and should be more emphasized. If I were a new user, I wouldn't think that challenges is where friends have challenged you, I would think that it was a place to add personal challenges for tasks.",94
1032,6,"Comp Analysis: Follow up: if you could come up with a single sentence tagline for your application, what would it be? Fun to brainstorm as a group! ",28
1033,6,Interaction Flow: Flows! Love the change with the navigation from burger to tabs. Definitely works well with the amount of paths available to the user. The one bit of flow left that's still a little fuzzy that I know your team is already working on is that from picking delivery/pickup to payments and so on. A lot of that was already mentioned in studio.,65
1034,6,Dev plan: Nice progress!,4
1035,6,The pages don't have their main functionality implemented.,8
1036,6,The task items must be clearly actionable. The week 7 tasks are too vague.,14
1037,6,A few too many tasks are in progress or incomplete this week. Adjust your next week's plan accordingly.,18
1038,6,Much of the functionality hasn't been implemented. The navigation is also still clunky as I am not exactly sure what I can do with the app and the skeleton. Task should be focused on the functionality rather than having user simply sign in and explore.,45
1039,6,"App: While the idea is creative, there is still much to be done about the functionality. It is unclear what to do upon logging in and doesn't really yet feel like a game. A good way to introduce someone to a game app is to have them learn while playing through it! It's unclear what exactly the game does as well. The symbols are still somewhat confusing. The navigation within the pages is still clunky and doesn't provide any indication as to what those pages actually are. ",88
1040,6,"Dev plan: Dev plan was incredibly blurry even when zoomed in. Because I couldn't read it, I can't provide points for anything related to the dev plan aside from what I can infer from the color coding. Please paste in a more clear and readable image of your dev plan for future assignments or provide a link to your plan. ",61
1041,6,Github link: You have a lot of files within your repository that can be condensed. That would make your git repo more organized and easier to navigate.,28
1042,6,"Interaction flow: Flow is pretty good right now, a lot easier to navigate through than in the past iteration. Main things missing here is just primary functionality implemented in all the pages. Remember, it can be mocked up/ wizard of oz'ed, but we still at least want some kind of functionality that can give users an idea of the interaction flow. ",62
1043,6,"App things: The way a user is supposed to interact with the friend group at the moment is a little unclear. Might want to have that decoupled from the other functionality on this main page so a user can create the group, set that aside, and partake in the rest of the app flow without worrying about its existence. Maybe for now you even want to just wizard of oz and have it work for adding anyone else who has signed on to the app. That way you can actually test it with two computers or something. You wanna get a MVP up and running as soon as you can (minimum viable product). Another major missing piece is how the vote environment gets created. Currently it just sorts of jumps to that mocked up page with two options. How functional do you want that part of the app to be? If it's too much trouble, you can focus on the random/restriction path first. At least get one of them working. ",171
1044,6,"Dev Plan: A lot of things are still in progress, make sure you have good communication with the team to get stuff done! Still quite a bit of functionality left to go so carefully work out the next week's plan. Also, a lot of these items are pretty fuzzy -- not a lot of concrete actionable tasks for week 6. Makes it harder to get them done. Have tasks such that the measure of completeness is implicit in the task. That which gets measured gets done. ",87
1045,6,"Interaction flow: Good progress on getting a lot more primary functionality done. A huge majority of the flowing issues right now are still stuck in not catering to the mobile form factor. Even things like the menu dropdown are cut off, and the bottom footer is pretty unusable. Some of the grouping of actions are a little oddly placed too. Login is under more, but creating accounts are slapped into the front page. If that placement is done on purpose, the purpose should be clear. Additionally, as we spoke in studio, the purpose of the colleges on the front page can be communicated better too. ++ Duplicated search bar. I think other levels deeper into the application are more clear, but the home page is the most overloaded with unclear actions. ",132

For a new post, would be good to be able to keep track of my own posts. If you provide search, you'll probably want that on different category pages too for drilling down, just like you have the tags (which I think you mentioned were going to be clickable).

1126,6,"Interaction Flow: Good progress! Navigation is definitely improved. I think the one area of confusion still with navigating is that the two main viewing tabs would likely be 'My questions' and 'All questions.' I would suggest having that on the bottom bar along with your home button. It doesn't make much sense to have to click into the menu and then to all questions to view all questions. Additionally, I think in general it may be a better idea to show 'All questions' as the default, and have be 'My questions' to be where you can tab to as a secondary 'track your stuff' function. That way, when users first enter the app, regardless of what they sign on to do, they are immediately exposed to questions that they can possibly answer -- you want people to answer stuff. ",140
1127,6,"Interaction flow: Everything is connected up pretty well, but I think flow can still be improved. For navigation in general, you can consider some other options (tabs/menu etc. to restructure how a user moves through all the main pages), although I wouldn't prioritize this because what you have works out alright with the home page having buttons to path deeper.  The place where someone might feel the most lost is when they get to match me up. There still isn't much indication of how long a user is supposed to stay in the matching phase, and what they ought to be doing.  Should I keep matching until there's no more? Until I find one I like? Until I find 3 I like? What should I do after the match me up phase? Etc. ",136
1128,6,"App things: In the next week, really focus on bringing out whatever key features you believe to make your app what it is. Soon you'll be testing that out with real, live, users! A wonderful task as a user with wizard of oz'ed data to complete would be filling out a profile with interests, playing with the match making system, finding out some awesome info, and having the org information ready to go from that point forward. You have that basic flow existing already, but now is the time to get it all feeling as real as possible. Think about what a user will want to do after each of those steps -- can you provide for that? I think the sign-up and interest filling out is pretty straight forward (maybe for the purpose of mocked functionality, you want to just let users pick interests from a list that is built from interests associated with the orgs using the app). Then from that, pull together a list of potential matches to put the user through. Make sure the matching page feels a little more comfortable with what exactly users are supposed to do. After the matching, make sure the user has somewhere to go to review their new findings with what awesome orgs they should get involved with. This doesn't have to exactly be the outline of how you should plan things from here, but it's an example of how I might think about the key parts of each step -- at each step, does the user know what to do, and what the next step should be after completion? If this all sounds way too vague feel free to contact me whenever~",283
1129,6,Development Plan: Good work! Really liking the detail on each of the task items. Would be useful to detail some tasks you will be using for your 'consistency check' in week 7. I think it's a great idea to have a list of basic tasks (just like the one in this assignment) to try to run through your app to gain an overall feel. Working out as many kinks before we dive into testing as you can would be awesome.,81
1130,6,"Interaction Flow: Server error on Profile tab :(. The main primary functionality that is still missing is the how one should engage in the actual exchange between a teacher/student. We currently see a contact button, but that's about it. The messenger tab also isn't doing anything yet either. Up to your team on whether or not you want to integrate messaging (if it's an important part of connecting with the other party, maybe it's important, but if it's only secondary to what other system you might put in place for connecting two people, you can put it on low priority and focus on other things). ",106
1131,6,"Dev Plan: Nice, definitely good to weed out things that are not worth implementing. Google/Facebook Oath is for sure not a priority. ",23
1132,6,"App: The field button is still ambiguous as to what it means. Perhaps in the help section, you can specify that the Field is the tree icon so the user is clear as to what that symbol means. The buy button currently doesn't have a functionality. Should direct at least to a placeholder element. One great way to teach a person how to use the app is by having them actually use it! You can maybe have them submit a photo as their first introduction to the app and earn a 'Derp.' This is a great way to show the user what your app is about while also giving them a sense of reward.",114
1133,6,"Competitive analysis: Good analysis, but how did you know that users ditched habit apps like Habitica? Was it in user reviews, interviews? Make sure to provide evidence for reasons that people might be abandoning those apps. ",37
1134,6,"App: The Village icon is the Home button, which I would've assumed is the homepage (even though the Mission Log is the homepage). Further, the Log Out button is typically pulled right on a nav bar to prevent users from accidentally clicking it while exploring the app. The ""New Mission"" button in mobile view is difficult to see and not very clear as to what it means. These are some simple navigational elements that can impede user experience in your app. When ""Complete"" is clicked, it does not direct to any page and instead leads to an error. ",99
1135,6,"Thank you for the clearly readable Dev plans! You are a little short on the functionality (analytics) and navigation (hitting the Questions link took me to a dead page), but I think you are headed in the right direction, especially if you shift your focus quickly once you get the input down to how people can view and interpret the responses in a meaningful way.",65
1136,6,"Would have like to see specific competitors listed. Also, in a number of places you ask users to recall rather than recognize (e.g. when putting in an assignment grade I have to recall what the overall weight is, even when I entered the number previously when I created the assignment). Some styling issues as well, but that does not matter at this point as we want you focusing on functionality (and you have a good bit already)!",77

1158,7,Data: Missing significant write capability. A lot of JSON reading but not much if any pushing into or editing memory/data.,20
1159,7,Very nicely done so far. I like the concept of Heroes and Villains and working together to earn points. I think the homepage could still use some work with understanding how the PowerUpp button works. Maybe having it faded out until the user selects a work out will make it more clear when and why they should press it.,59
1160,7,Notes: - I like how you've set up the two users to expedite the testing process,16
1161,7,- I would look into https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag to make things look a bit more fitting on an actual mobile phone,19

1165,7,"Fantastic job with the app. Looking pretty much complete in functionality to me! Everything else is also well in place -- dev plan, links etc.",25
1166,7,One thing that I would definitely change is indicating somehow that the buttons that aren't clickable in the menu aren't. I remember observing people trying to click it in studio.,31
1167,7,Here are some considerations for some other possible changes: - Live update (but you're already working on that :P),19
1168,7,- Option for poll leader to vote (I can see sometimes people who create the room/polls wanting to be able to vote themselves),23
1169,7,Good work!,2
1170,7,The home page still needs some work in terms of the mental model. It would seem as though the user can click on the images below. May be better to just have level progress bars without the images. There also isn't a clear connection between achievements and how that relates to the pet. There should also be a way to prevent users from unlocking irrelevant achievements rather than just being able to click on any of them.,78
1171,7,Notes: - Even some simple form validation like the required attribute for user input would be handy,17
1172,7,Can I log out,5
1173,7,Would be nice to have a way to see just my own posts,15
1174,7,Data: Submitting things like posts and comments work well for server persistence but the voting isn't quite there. I would look into $.post requests for that.,26
1175,7,"In general, looks like your app is pretty far along! I would work on some of the things mentioned above. I think priority would be getting the votes to work, and then maybe being able to see my own posts. ",41

1193,7,"I like the timer functionality, but it seems a bit redundant and confusing to have both a percentage scale and a timer. Because you focus on the timing of brushing, I suggest keeping the timer clock instead. Maybe make it clear from the main ""Game"" page that the teeth you're collecting is for your animal (right now, it's only clear if you click the Help button).

To really see exchange in action, I would like to see a user being able to offer up something to teach, and another user to be able to jump in and see that listing. Being able to actually drop each other messages would be extra awesome, but given the amount of time, having your faked message page works well.

A couple things that might require some more clarity is how much is necessary to level up and more confirmation within the inventory page as to how the Friendler's mood is changing rather than using the item and then having to go back to the Friendler page to see the change in mood. Also, does checking in with friends earn more points than alone? The little encouraging messages also stack up after leaving the app idle for a while, which might be irritating for a user.

I agree that showing history could be valuable, but question whether you can get accurate test results just by showing fake data for people. Also, for the employees move away from aggregating results in a pie chart  to time-series graph (most likely a line chart) since people are more likely to want to see trends in their responses over time,  (e.g. why did I give low ratings last month...) rather than just knowing that 30% of all their responses were in a particular category.

In addition, the first item merely says to explain the idea of the app. You should explicitly write out a script on how to explain the idea of the app. Another person should be able to read the protocol and run a participant through it.

I still think your A/B testing should have focused on more of the core functionality of the app. Changing the profile picture is a peripheral and additional functionality, but not one that is really necessary for your app. Focusing more on the quiz play or creating a quiz aspect would have made for a more useful A/B test.

1535,9,- 'Yes' and 'No' should probably be responses to some question. Are you actually prompting people a question? Maybe better matched with 'I like this club' and 'Pass' etc.,31
1536,9,Changes list: One of the main changes you mention here is to simply move things below the fold. This might work for a little bit but it's probably not best to rely on 'tricking' the user to achieve the goal of faster decisions. I imagine after a user realizes just once that the button is below the fold that the entire strategy would collapse. Any other ways you can think of to enhance the interface in efforts of your goal?,81
1537,9,"A couple fixes to your app in this final week: There should be some way to edit your friends list (i.e. rename, delete friends). Again, there should be some confirmation as to how many points it takes to level up or whether checking in with multiple friends is better than 1 or none, etc. A stretch goal for some of the gamification elements you guys were mentioning could be to have challenges or quests (i.e. ""Check into a lunch place with a friend!"" or ""Check in with 2 or more friends!"").

Add more."" or something of that nature just so the entire middle of the screen isn't just blank.  When creating a mission, it isn't clear which button is the Runner or the Resource. Having a label of some sort or a placeholder image there might be more useful for the user to prevent confusion. When I tried clicking ""Run"" after adding all my tasks and objectives, a box that said ""Starting mission"" came up but nothing happened after that.",98

1552,9,I feel that you should also test for the core functionality of the  app (i.e. the trading card part or the re-roll part) as these are essential for your app. Some other possible revisions for different portions of your UI should also be addressed. You may also want to think about how the chore cards should be displayed rather than scrolling through 10+ chores.,66

One issue I didn't see described in the list of revisions, is the fact that the  Piggy closet page is not connected to any other page! the hamburger menu doesn't link back to the main screen. The one thing that would add the final bit of polish would be to give some sort of indication on the dashboard as to how many piggy points I have, how long until I accrue more, etc. Being reminded of the piggy points increases the motivation to actually interact w/ the piggy. 1 point off because the closet screen not being completely connected is a polish issue and ought to be fixed before the demo.

I'm sure you're focusing on it for the final presentations, but it does make a big difference that the calendar isn't working. I also know it's very close to the deadline, but you might consider, for demo purposes, wizard of oz'ing the typical interaction for receiving an event after setting up. So instead of taking until 10 pm, have a wait time of 10 seconds, and then display the event on the recent page. ",101
1556,9," I would recommend for the demo on Friday to focus on having navigation working properly. It looks like in the version I'm looking at now there's something janky going on w/ sessions, possibly due to facebook login, but I keep getting redirected to the login screen. I would also avoid saying  your system isn't under maintenance (too honest) Instead, you're offering me the convenience of signing in w/ Facebook (yay!).

1689,11,Video doesn't provide what the motivation for the app is.,10

1701,11,Awesome video as well! Fantastic opera assignment and music. Well done well done.,13
1702,11,Great work on the EC assignments. The only thing is the video could have been more appealing by walking through a scenario in which a user would use the app in real life rather than walking through its features.,40
1703,11,Great job!,2
1704,11,Video was very entertaining; glad to see Arvind learned how to properly slice vegetables haha.,15

1722,11,Video could have made the user need or the scenario clearer.,11

1724,11,Awesome reach of geographically diverse audiences!,6
1725,11,Great job with the video too; love it!,8
1726,11,"It would have been nice to visit some other inspirations that you might not have included in your first submission. Though you advertised the app on list serves, it might have been more effective to post to Facebook, Twitter, etc. As such, there is not much evidence that your app was noticed through social media outlets.

1731,11,Great work guys!,3
1732,11,"Great revisiting inspiration assignment. While you posted the app to social media sites, no evidence shown about its reach to the public or whether people actually used it. Would be useful to include how many people liked/retweeted/+1 the post or a Google Analytics page about the app's usage. Nice work!",50
1733,11,Good work!,2
1734,11,It would have been great to include some of these competitive analysis in your poster as well!,17

1737,11,nice work !,3
1738,11,Good work!,2
1739,11,"No need to show loggin in. There's no need to show a screen and aimlessly scroll up and down(or if there is an aim, make it clear to the viewer). The gameplay section does not need to be that long to make your point.",44
1740,11,"Revisit: A lot of these do not fit into ""How are you different from _____? Why would people use your application instead of _____? In what situations would people use _____ instead of your application."" ",36
