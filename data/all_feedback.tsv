I would like to see some changes in how the data is viewed and displayed, like categories, that would make it easier for the user to initially recognize what's going to expire soon	33	1	1	1	3
I'm confused about the layout. I assume each of the columns corresponds to now, walking, or waiting, but they're presented somewhat offset and with much whitespace so its not immediately clear they're correlated	33	1	1	1	3

Although I don't have a problem with making the row of prices + values on top of the minimum, it makes your visual design inconsistent. Why not just show the full price in each column?	35	1	1	1	3
being generous with this one i think you should redesign heavily and then just pick one small feature to change your redesign still doesnt make it very clear what the emotion tracker is used for	35	1	1	1	3

im curious how it works unless youve pushed a different commit to heroku you seem to have a backupjson but that isnt used in the code let me know so i can award the point	35	1	1	0	2
In terms of visual design, I hope the typeface and the size of font for temperature could be larger and the icon of sun could be smaller and be put underneath the text of temperature.	35	1	1	0	2
Its simplistic which is good. I think that adds a good element to it. It is hard to follow, so I think more elaboration is what youre aiming for would help this design a lot.	35	0	0	0	0
make sure to implement the images that youre trying to collect clicks on as buttons to be able to catch the click events i think thats the most straightforward way but maybe theres another way	35	1	1	0	2
The final section in the video is the flash card. I wish you can blend the info into your current user interface rather than a pop-up window. The pop-up window is not a good choice.	35	1	1	1	3
the only way to get to the income page is from the register link is this what is intended why isnt there a way to get there after the login also what does equipmentspersonal mean	35	1	0	0	1
Usually people rest their hand on the whiteboard as they write, so that would probably show up unnecessarily on the digitized lesson. Maybe you could require that the user write with some sort of stylus	35	1	1	1	3
What exactly is this progress circle supposed to mean? there's already a timeline shown at the bottom. I feel like this doesn't really convey much meaningful info that can't be presented concisely in another way.	35	1	0	1	2
When opening the Google application, I would want to know when the phone interview is (time and date). Also, I'd want to read up on the recruiter, so a shortcut to linked-in would be nice!	35	1	1	0	2
Yard: Curious as to what the input for the yard scale is. It would be cool to show relevant personalized information as someone walks up with their Apple watch and the yard interface senses it.	35	1	1	0	2
you will need to polish your user interface a little bit in order for it to be appeasing to a large number of users use a design framework like bootstrap for starters to accomplish this	35	1	1	1	3
adding images doesnt work there is no delete button when a user didnt give any information in the add template and she accidentally clicks the add button what would be the most intuitive thing to happen	36	1	1	0	2
also you might want to think about striking the balance between burdening the users for managing all the data they ought to enter and the amount of value that can be generated by using that data	36	1	1	0	2
Also, if user want to upload their portfolio or art work, how do they upload them through this app ? or is there a way for them to connect the app to their personal website ?	36	1	0	0	1
assumes user has a thermometer with them how are the pictures used in a scientific way generous with the point here i think the core functionality is here but the data driving the functionality isnt practical	36	1	0	1	2
clean design but at this point here should be actual images for the dressing suggestions let me know if they are shown for particular events in which case i may be able to award the point	36	1	1	0	2
Despite the actual glasses screen being on the inch scale, I wouldn't consider augmented reality glasses an inch-scale interface. When they overlay information on your environment, they do so more on the foot to yard scale	36	1	0	1	2
does not show more than three suggestions of what to bring at a time even though there are more in the json another possible bug is that events for tomorrow also affect what to bring today	36	1	1	0	2
I am not sure if it is my computer issue, but no matter how many times I refresh, I cannot see your video. so I guess I just give some advices based on your plain text	36	1	1	0	2
I am not sure if this is a valid lead user since the "EMTs in Tijuana" is like a group of people and it is a similar problem faced by EMT people in any dangerous area.	36	1	1	0	2
I dont know how useful the image overlay is on a day to day basis __I might explore more options like a pregnancy digest up to this point, for the yard scale to diversify it's use	36	1	1	0	2
I feel like if you are in a rush, I don't know if you need to decide which dining hall to go to. Most likely you would already have one in mind which you frequent often.	36	1	0	0	1
I like certain screens in the inch scale. The timer and color are a nice combination. The task list, forms, and check list, and many symbols seem to be a lot to display on the watch.	36	1	1	0	2
I like how you use a real user to present the interface. However, the left swiping with finger interface is a little confusing. The saving function definitely makes sense and is really helpful in this situation	36	1	1	0	2
I like seeing the ongoing and upcoming panels, but I'd also be concerned about where things are and how to get to them. Would be nice to have a little map showing the different panel locations	36	1	1	0	2
I like the icons that help people label what the data is on the watch interface. I wish the font on the watch interface was not small. Maybe you can just use icons or fewer words.	36	1	1	0	2
I'm not quite sure what the purpose of the calendar is. It would be great if it marks important due dates for the month so it's easy to see how the user should budget their time.	36	1	1	0	2
It might be a good idea to sort the layout on the public display because now they looks like kind of mess. And I am glad to see Robert Gougelet is in the best standing :D.	36	1	1	1	3
Maybe you could show the surge zone on the map since users might want to walk out a different direction (it's closer to home or they don't want to walk a certain direction for safety issues)	36	1	1	0	2
most interactions not implemented but should at least have some signifier of where they will be for example there should be some icon or way to see where the notification list will be in the app	36	1	1	0	2
Not sure how the functionality of the watch would work because it seems like you would need to swipe a lot ot adjust certain things. Would recommend not to have so many features on the watch.	36	1	1	1	3
similar feedback as for the first prototype i know you are thinking about this but be careful not to make this an informational guide think instead how to empower trainers in connecting with their pet more	36	1	0	1	2
Since the user is using the camera, maybe allow the user to record or take pictures? Just an idea I had that allows users to go back to a certain Hololens demo they thought was cool.	36	1	1	0	2
some of the prototypes interface is limited how do users navigate from the sign up page how do users log in from the log in page how do users manage different companies on the 4th page	36	1	1	0	2
There is no save button for the predefined modes of lighting. And throwing movie in between evening and morning is kind of random. You can also set a time for different modes to turn on automatically.	36	1	1	0	2
This could get messy so might be a good idea to find the most useful features (possibly ask some people how they note take) and collecting the most popular freatures into an easy to use API.	36	1	1	0	2
This is a very good idea because most of the students want their notes to be clean and clear. It's a good idea to offer scientific method to mark down their notes and improve the efficiency.	36	1	1	1	3
very thorough and detailed observation report i really enjoyed reading it it conveys lots of design opportunities is engaging by telling real stories and serves its best as a qualitative piece of writing in my opinion	36				0
Waiters often don't have two hands to interact with a watch. So, if a waiter is busy, he could shake the watch instead to signify that he wants to pass the service alert to someone else.	36				0
again drop the redeemable prizes they just dont make sense especially at this stage of development id rather see more gamelike functionality like an avatar levels and skillsattributes to increase by playing the other citizen science apps	37				0
assignment instructions explain that the development plan should be included within the pdf submission itself rather than a link so that i can compare tasks done this week to the tasks you originally planned the week before	37				0
Because people may use dish washing machine everyday and the range of users is large from different cultures and ages, it's better have a clean and clear interface that people understand how to use immediately without learning.	37	1	1	1	3
For interface 2, I wish you can place the message on the right of the picture, so students can look at the pictures and the message at the same time. It may looks more organized and intuitive.	37				0
For the Yard scale, I don't see much necessity to put the sound waves graph at the lower half part since it looks like you don't have interaction to control or edit using the Yard Scale display	37				0
Great job with the design, it definitely looks very clean and organized. I'd recommend replacing the announcements, scripts, and videos with actually relevant content to the comic book creator (also that script font isn't readable right now)	37				0
I am wondering how would the augment reality goggle work since I don't think people will wear the goggle while sleeping and if not, I am not sure how would the display show the information to users.	37				0
I don't know too much about it but I am not sure if a progress bar is the best way to display something like judges found, think about what you want users to do with that information.	37				0
i dont see any difference is that a mistake if so let me know on piazza also the redesigns need to be in one heroku app just different routes but you didnt lose the point for this	37				0
I like how you show the date for the phone interview but the font size should be bigger and with the dark blue/grey background it it hard to focus on. The red does draw attention though :)	37				0
I like that you let the user drag passengers around because that is easier and more intuitive than typing for each car. I wish that there were automatic messages, like buttons or options from a drop down.	37	1	1	1	3
I really like the blue and black theme of the interface but I think the red kind of throws it off. I would recommend a different color. Also do you need all those ads at the bottom?	37				0
I'd like to see the room numbers labeled onto the map. The number seems like a count down until vacancy? Does this include people who might have the room reserved right afterwards? What does the checkmark mean?	37				0
I'm not sure just one picture is good enough to inspire potential DIYers, maybe you could add a gallery of pics or require pictures from different angles to give people a better idea of the item requirements	37				0
It is a good idea for people who extremely care the format and layout of their notes. By using this note helper, they can save time by avoiding decide which format they should choose to take notes.	37				0
Not exactly sure of everything that it can do. Which makes this part hard to critque. I know that it is for reading articles from the desprciption you gave, but maybe a more clear video would help.	37				0
Not very well thought-out. Posture detection seems implausible, watch seems to not provide useful info, and the wall computer seems to not be related to the foot or inch interface - how does partnership add to posture?	37				0
The app seems to address an issue which is very prevalent in collegiate life - as well as everyday transportation regarding a community. I can see this app being very useful to a wide audience of people!	37				0
the colors are kind of jarring also the sliders and images are not optimized for mobile remember that you are developing a mobile web app so all images screens should be optimized for a responsive mobile design	37				0
the meaningful thoughts about heuristic evaluations is very generic it could have been done better it doesnt talk about how it helped you in particular or how you were able to help the other team in detail	37				0
the second prototype is unique however an application that just blocks distracting websites can be too superficial and may be difficult to implement research more into how to motivate your users to stay focused on their studies	37				0
the start date may not be too important to fill in so maybe that could be automatically populated also let me know what deviceapp to test your app on it appears too small in chromes responsive mode	37				0
think about deadlines so that you are on track each week also mention some stretch goals try to have tasks distributed across members instead of saying all since its unlikely to have all of you code together	37				0
A map is nice but what happens if there is an outlier? I could see that skewing the suggested hostels and possibly missing content. The list view could maybe expand when the user isn't interacting with the map.	38				0
Doing some research and rearranging the grid of the overall design might also increase readability. For example, on the tablet, changing up the grid might make it easier to include more information that is helpful to the user.	38				0
Eyes tend to gravitate from left to right, top to bottom. Unless you want to emphasize the layout over the stat info, you might want to consider switching the orientation of the stat panel and the house layout.	38				0
Foot - I'm not exactly sure what the camera, security, and appliances have to do with the app - from the persona, it seems to be about light energy and savings. How does a camera tie into this?	38				0
Going off from the comment above. I think the purpose of this application should be helping people developing the habits of not procrastinating, and break from the entertainments decisively and focus on their school works whenever they should.	38				0
honestly its a great idea and app but the navigation is incomplete such as relying on the browser back function when a more explicit cancel equivalent button is required also how to quit a workout in the middle	38				0
I like how all of the face data and the daily process is written on the yard scale. I wish you had the option to order products online. You can add that in the wear to buy section.	38				0
I like the separation of fridge and freezer but I do not know if that is important for the purpose of your interface, which keeps track of all food, so maybe you can have them together at first.	38				0
I like the way that it monitors that there is a personal/ professional balance, but it may be tough to keep up with because I wouldnt type in "computer time" I would probably just go on the computer.	38	1	1	1	3
I think it is a great idea to have the UI information box pops out to tell the related information of a photo and I think tthis can be a greatttt user case for museum or photo exhibition	38				0
I think your lights display is a little overwhelming. Since you're already gong to have a brightness scale, maybe you don't need on and off buttons? You can get it to dim all the way to turn of?	38				0
I wish it was more visually appealing. I know it's hard with vim editor but is there an easier way to see the different commands? So a newbie programmer can quickly see what they can do with vim.	38				0
I would like to see the modes automatically update based upon previous settings. For example, if I walk into my usual coffee shop then my mode will automatically update based upon my last visit to the coffee shop.	38				0
I'm not sure how in depth the task names are, but it would be cool to be able to view more details about a certain task for clarification in case someone isn't sure what a task name means.	38				0
That's amazing -- three types of switches in the same keyboard. It would be really interesting to see what kind of keyboards could be designed for these lead users -- computer science students who code or game often.	38				0
the one thing i wonder about the functionality is that the user could just click the same thing over and over again maybe there could be a way to increase the challenge after users choose a certain action	38				0
The tablet screen is split between two uses- actually viewing the art and viewing its info. I would have the main screen be either the info or the art, and scroll or swipe to bring in the other.	38				0
try to be more clear who the target user is going by the video it could be either students or even as broad as anyone who doesnt cook often and relies on frozen meals ie it is ambiguous	38				0
video doesnt show the other side the java tutors side in this case of the story this is important because perhaps a user who hires someone can also offer hisher services to other people on the same platform	38	1	1	1	3
When you are designing your interface, it's better to offer users freedom to customaize their sections and notes since different people may have different ways to mark down their notes, but you can give basic guideline for them.	38				0
you didnt need to draw the web browser ie url box search box etc just whats on your app you put detail into all of the wrong places a big button with identify your plant is pretty meaningless	38				0
your open in map button doesnt do anything even after moving the circle i dont have any information about the actual crime activity also you need to specify a legend within the app describing what each color signifies	38				0
also how does the vertical feed interface of the buddy system differ for each of the parties does the left column represent me and the right column represent my buddy can i have multiple buddies for the same task	39				0
AlsO, ambient sound cannot be a better way of providing immersive experience to the user, to let user better tasting the old ages showed up in the photo, especially when it is an iconographic photo that has significant meaning.	39				0
At each scale, it is clear how each box functions. I think with color and different fonts/weights, it will be even clearer and you can remove some of the cluttered text to increase the overall readability of each interface.	39				0
be careful about having todo lists as these sorts of apps end up being gamified lists maybe think about the idea of microtasks and how you could make a game out of completing microtasks in the scheme of macrotasks	39	1	1	0	2
For the foot display, it might be cool if you can pull up you and your friend's schedule. Then find an event that can fit both your schedules. That way it automatically filters out events that you can't attend	39				0
For the foot interface, the profile picture for the user does not need to be that large because it does not relate to the task but takes space. Use space to show as much info for restaurant as possible.	39	1	1	1	3
Have recommandation of food for inch or foot interface if possible. Because there are large amount of people who do not know what to eat, the recommendation section can help them to decide. Good to have featured food section.	39	1	1	1	3
how is the priority computed if different users have different ideas about how the priority is computed for example we have measures such as due date approx hours difficulty progress can users create a custom way of assigning priorities	39				0
I can see why you'd want to see which seats are taken in a room and what the slides are for a lecture, but I don't think you'd need to see them at the same time on one interface.	39				0
I definitely like interface 1 more than interface 2. Interface 1 is more convenient and familiar because users have already been trained in using their phones, whereas it is more confusing to have to learn a new interface(interface 2).	39	1	1	1	3
I felt like the home page of your design is a little bit non-necessary because it can be in the the same style of your next page design, or just be a add-on notification part in your second design.	39	1	1	1	3
I like how you used a smart mirror interface for the yard scale. I wish it could offer feedback on your routine. It could watch the gestures you are doing and offer advice if you are doing it wrong.	39				0
I like your design of the watch interface. However, one thing that confuses me is that in the watch interface, what does the nnuber represent if I just watch those numbers instead watch at your explanation on the right.	39				0
I particularly like the use of VIM keycaps to help ease cognitive load with a scaffolded artifact. As a gamer and content generator myself, I use mechanical keyboards all the time to help improve my typing and response time.	39				0
I really like the idea behind this. I think people definitely need to be able to visualize the furniture in their room. For your prototype, it is a little hard for me to tell exactly what the picture does?	39				0
I think the idea is interesting. Having the ability to block out certain noises is certainly a useful function. In the next iteration, I would like to see some automation to the process itself and some specific use cases.	39				0
im still unclear as to how the racing component might motivate users why would users care about beating an avatar wouldnt users be able to achieve the same thing if they just set an alarm for when to leave	39				0
It's unclear to me if the entire column is clickable or just the labels with the icon on top. For example, if I click +3m, will it highlight the car option? Or I have to click the "Now" label?	39				0
its not clear who are the target users overall interesting idea of using social collaboration as a form of accountability as i said in my feedback in person i think some goalbased quests might be good for this app	39				0
other than that the major functionalities are there which is good sign moving forward i would encourage your team to iron out your major known bugs and to finalize the interactions designs of your major components keep it up	39				0
The queue is a nice idea in case you are late and don't know if your order has been called already but I think you are giving too much information and it is taking up a lot of space.	39				0
using items in the garden dont persist so its difficult to see the causeeffect between item interactions its also a bit confusing to understand that you are working with other people to keep your garden maintained through your budget	39	1	1	1	3
you should want to wireframe your important pages its not really clear what your app does because contribute doesnt mean anything especially when it looks like you are just submitting a task and whether or not you completed it	39	1	1	1	3
based on this storyboard i would just develop a better calendar also where do you think the game component might be useful in this how might you address this efficient timekeeping in a way that doesnt involve calendars or alarms	40				0
comparison was supposed to be made at the violation level you confused this rubric item with the next one on reflection you could have also talked more about the brief how did they compare in actually meeting the design objective	40				0
do you plan to filter as per the wireframe or sort companies think about which other columnsinformation you may want to give the option to show the wireframe looks better than the table if you just want to indicate status	40				0
For the tablet interfect, I'd like to see just a small map (similar to uber) with prices in different areas that shows where I would need to walk, my total fare, and how long the total travel time would be.	40				0
For the yard size, it doesn't make sense to drag one assignment to the other side. If you want the users know what tasks they have done, it is better to have a clear category to organize all the assignment.	40				0
I am not very sure whether the weather information is a related in formation for for an task like that. If possible, I would wish the button could be larger so it would be easier to for people to click	40				0
i like the overhaul styling done to application since i last saw it the application appears to be almost bug freesee my other commentand is working nicely major props on getting a mongo database from the looks of your github	40				0
I like the watch interface. But there are couple things that I feel like you can do better. First I don't think it blue rectangle is needed. If you want to use it for aesthetic purpose, make it look nicer	40				0
i like this idea of exploration to produce better navigation results it might also be fun to think about how people can get creative with their location inputs and what types of rewards they can get for exploring different areas	40				0
I wish you can replace the "Drivers" and "Passenger" in the "Send a notification" page to the exact name of the recipients since sometimes you might not want to send message to all of them. Give more freedom to users.	40				0
In order to have more interaction bewteen the users and the phone, I wish you could add a function that users have freedom to turn the project on the phone by themselves in addition to the change by the presentors.	40				0
it looks to me that this prototype is catering only a small subset of features that other social media platforms already provide you might want to think about how to answer why should i use this service instead of xxx	40				0

The initial screen is a little overwhelming. I'm not sure exactly how to fix it but off the top of my head, I think some of your features, like remaining requiremens and course pool don't have to always be shown.	40				0
The traditional monthly view is quite recognizeable and I think it would be interesting to see how you could change that interaction at different scales (week, day, etc) and possibly incorporating little hacks that people use at each scale too.	40				0
When working with padding, I frequently want the right and left padding to be equal. Maybe if you tap on an element, you could have an option to enlarge L and R padding at the same time in equal increments.	40				0
With the large scale of a yard display, you can fit much more information on the screen. It would be nice to display complementary massage movements the user can further explore if they enjoy that massage type or target region	40				0
As I don't really play games, I am not sure if this is the right interface for users. The design to me is kind of confused. Be sure to include the signifiers to improve the learning curve for the new users.	41				0
At the yard scale, I like having the ability to actually see the meal. That's something that is important to a lot of users as it helps make ordering easier if we know what is going to be served to us.	41				0
Especially at the watch interface, I like the simplicity of the design and only displaying very little functionality. I think the icons can be a bit onfusing though so possibly changing how those appear would make it easier on the user.	41				0
For idea 1 interface, I wish you categorize all the filters(requirements) into clearer and cleaner orders and sections. The message on the top would better to put on top of the lists of future requirements because they belongs to similar funtionality.	41	1	1	1	3
Good job connecting the persona, task, and interface.The button on your inch scale is hard to hit and the function of swiping up/down and right/left might messed up causing errors when user trying to swipe left but ended up swiping up.	41				0
I like the layout design, it makes sense and fits plenty of information on screen. However, maybe the left side of the screen could be minimized while viewing individual applications since the user probably doesn't need to see everything at once.	41				0
I really like the app! It would be cool if you could click on the picture/name of the person you are interviewing with and it would bring you to their linked in page so you can research them before the interview.	41				0
i think something you havent addressed is the idea of creating a routine and reaching goals which is what you focused your pov on be careful of making this feel like another mint app how might you move beyond inputting budgets	41				0
I think the tablet view has the right kind of personalized input into the app. The TV view might be able to be more generalized since it is meant to be public, so there could be more collaborative views between people.	41				0
I wish that there was a better reason to keep the Personal section. I would rather look at my calendar for that. Here's how you can fix it. Remove personal section and keep the app as a "searching for" app instead.	41				0
i wish the app had more help and documentation in other words perhaps a how to use page to cater to new users i would not know at first that you can customize a list a blocked websites in the settings	41				0
If you want to generalize your Yard display to be able to record more types of music rather than just singing a song. Instead of showing up lyrics, you can also showing up the stave or music score for musical instruments.	41				0
interesting and diverse activities and interaction observation i think theres big design space related to enhancing and maintaining the current work efficiency flow but making it less cluttered and making space for new tasks work contexts to be stored good job	41				0
ive been a fan of your idea and i think you have a nicely polished app i think the next steps will be to flesh out the functionality and try to separate your newsfeed section from other photo apps like instagram	41	1	1	0	2
my main suggestions for improvement would be to make the fitness pov more explicit and more fleshed out in the app interface and to improve on sizing of text and images for both desktop and mobile views good work this quarter	41				0
need to be able to add a task and have it show up add more simple widgets to collect additional information no need to make the analytics page update with data just put more charts and other visualizations of more data	41				0
Not sure about the snooze button. I think the most important thing is that if I were a video game addictor, I think I need to cultivate the will and habit of breaking out of the video game without any hesitation.	41				0
The user could be passively using the applicaiton and a notification could pop up when the price falls within range and it could notify the user where they need to go in order for them to find the lowest surge price.	41				0
theres a minor bug when pressing the back button if a user navigates to the members page clicks back to group and then the upper left back button they are navigated back to the members page instead of the home page	41				0
When users are in certain page, it is better to have an indication on the top bar for certain item. For example, if users are in Donations page, you can emphaze the term by color or larger font or bold font.	41				0
Which interface scale is this UI being presented on? it's not too clear from the video, or what type of setting (at a desk, in a car, etc) the app is going to be used from. Will it require internet access?	41				0
While the idea may have some attractiveness to people who don't need to worry about security, the presentation of this idea is not fleshed out. It looks like a set of slides rather than a UI that I can touch through.	41				0
Yard: I am not sure why there are 4 blocks that say gilman and myers if the person is already there so maybe switch it to one block? Also black on white is typically not the bets option for reading text.	41				0
At the inch, I like the abiltiy to solve a simple puzzle. Also having different puzzles would be a nice addition. But again (I know for me), solving something complex would get hard and annoying especially if the alarm keeps going off.	42				0
For idea 2, I believe it is better to allow students to offer their price. Under this situation, this is a compeitition market. Users may get a lower price with satisfactory products. The compeititon can add motivation and energy to this market.	42				0
Freezing the screen in the middle of the game can be annoying for users. Maybe it can calculate how long a game will take and if it's past the set time for sleep, it won't allow the user to start another game	42				0
good for reflection but this isnt the comparison we were looking for it was supposed to be at the level of the violations themselves as for reflection talk more about the brief how did they compare in actually meeting the design objective	42				0
great creativity in this idea think about how to make it more competitive or unique from other artsharing apps also target the destressing pov a little more its not super clear form the app itself that this would specifically help people destress	42				0
I am not sure if this is what you want but to make better use the functionality of AR headset, you would introduce more gesture or voice controls to let the user manipulating the object or 3D holograms in the augmented reality.	42				0
I like the layout of the inner part without the outtter grey area but I feel like the color scheme is a bit dull especially with the purpose of getting someone hyped up to dance. Brighter colors (and more colors) are necessary.	42				0

I think it might be a good idea to have the watch vibrates when it detects how the students' seating behavior is wrong. So that students know they should correct their seating position when they are in a long time of work	42				0
I think that this is a good idea for the specific case of hostels. I still think there is major overlap with AirBnB, though. I recall that there was the idea that this was going to be a trip planner type thing?	42				0
In terms of the interface for the dispalcher display. I hope that you could add more colors to it so that user can easily distinguish the difference of the interface above and below. Not sure what does the volumn button do though.	42				0
inch - having a map display on a watch might not be the best idea, as most people have bad eyesight and wouldn't be able to easily distinguish map features. perhaps provide step by step instructions, one step at a time instead	42				0
Inch: I like that it warns the user when they're about to do something they're not supposed to. The buttons might be a bit close to each other though for an inch interface. Perhaps you can utilize swiping instead of tapping buttons.	42				0
It looks like everyone is getting picked up from one spot, but I think it would make more sense if the pickup location could be set by car. That way people who live closer to each other could travel in one car.	42				0
It would be useful to have a watch interface; I imagine that a student planning a hackathon can be extremely busy. The watch UI could do things like, update progress, assign tasks through voice input, keep track of the hackathon countdown, etc..	42				0
It's a good idea trying to emphasize due dates that are coming up, but the red text on dark blue is hard on the eyes. Perhaps choosing a different shade/color or even a different way to emphasize the content would be better.	42				0
It's better to use the place as the main in the control panel instead of categorizing places to on or off. In other words, set the places on the left for example, and indicate they are on or off for each term.	42				0

On the foot scale, I would add a video of the fight as well. The inch scale would be too small for this, but I feel like there is enough real estate on the tablet to display the fight if you scroll down.	43				0
On the inch scale, I think that the percentage and the visual doesn't give me much information or feedback on what I should improve. I would suggest have separate bars for your shoulder, neck, and hips to be more specific in your feedback.	43				0
On your inch scale, the screen looks like information display, but doesn't offer any indication on where to tap on the screen. You may want to add a button as indication. I also don't know what the vertical scroll will lead me to.	43				0
one suggestion is that currently on the find missions page the missions are all laid out horizontally which makes the margins of the screen very narrow it might be useful to make it more of a scrollable list or a standard grid layout	43				0

People usually only buy shoes if they think they look nice. It's cool that you make suggestions based on a foot scan, but there are only three shoes shown. I would add more room for the shoe suggestions, and maybe show an on-foot preview	44				0
The design is minimalist which I like. I wish that the watch didn't have so many options and buttons for such a tiny screen. If it is just for viewing purposes, maybe controls could be done via voice. Love the use of a mirror.	44				0
To add on to ^^, maybe you could automatically log the user out on set intervals and force them to do a dance. That might be inconvenient, but if you need an app to just remind yourself to move around it might be necessary!	44				0
Using an old fan out of a PSU is an effective solution to this issue. However, it lacks creativity. For lead user and their innovation, it should be something like new remarkable tech or design idea that will push the whole market go further.	44				0

you might want to think about what is going to be lost from removing the physical artifacts paper resumes for example from the interaction some recruiters might want to jot down some things quickly so that they can look for the candidate efficiently later	44				0
again how does this app differ from things like mint the one difference i see is the wishlist but i dont see the full motivational value of the app think about goalbased budgets or some way to reward users beyond just showing them their budget	45				0
I like how you found outlines of shoes to make your prototype realistic. I also like how you used the shake functionality on the Apple watch. I'm not too sure about what the purpose is of the competition between two people on the year scale.	45				0
I think changing and combining the different noises (white, brown, etc) would be the most relevant for me personally. It could automatically change to your preferred setting upon entering a new location. This would help keep me in an ambient mindset even on the move.	45				0
I think that this would be better off being angled more towards a multi-user experience. E.g. you would create an event and invite all your friends, then everyone has a centrally located information hub regarding everything about the upcoming trip in one easily, accessible location.	45				0
I understand that there are lots of part of lighting control but I still wish that you can make the interface cleaner and clearer. Currently, the interface is a bit messy and it takes me much time to figure out the boundary for each section.	45				0
im wondering if there might be a better way to convey your idea without a basic map at the moment it looks more like a standard navigation app maybe the homepage can instead be the missions page to convey more of the exploratory game aspect	45				0
its fine since youve shared readable images of the prototype on piazza however if this were to be presented you would lose the point also a prototype shouldnt have too much placeholder text or squiggly lines and use sample text from a typical situation instead	45				0

the observations were detailed but the specific breakdowns and successes of each subject were unclear an example of a breakdown would be what did drake struggle with when he was writing notes by hand what advantages does drake have by writing his notes by hand	45				0
the subjectivity of heuristic evaluations can be very helpful though because it allows you to think about all your users and the problems each might have with your prototype that said the constraints of the heuristics may in fact be a limitation of the process	45	1	1	1	3
there was one minor bug that i found so make sure to fix that before testing also the app can use some polishing with the aesthetics perhaps add a border to to do history and add task to make it look more like a button	45				0
This is an interesting and very real problem space! I've done what Patricia has done in using Google Maps to pick a hostel and plan trips since there's nothing out there that really helps solve this problem. Looking forward to seeing your design for this!	45				0

At the login page, I wish you can delete the sign up button because you already have two choices for users to chooce, donor or recipient. You can make them as two buttons and click to register. Then, users do not need to do two steps.	46	1	1	1	3
Foot: I like that the search results show the relevant information someone might be looking for when finding a restaurant (especially wait time). It's also cool that you can view the actual location of tables (useful especially for date planning) and the menu while you're waiting.	46				0
For the first interface of inch size, I like the circle idea. However, the design is not consistant across all inch size interface. I believe it is better to have same design for comparison since it helps users to better understand the meaning across all interfaces.	46				0
I am not sure what is the number means in your inch scale interface. Probably you need to add some words or lines to explain the elements on the watch because it will become a problem when someone is new to the device or football games.	46	1	1	1	3
i cant figure out a way to change the alarm also make sure your app is responsive to mobile currently you have made your screen very small which when scaled on a mobile screen makes your app just a tiny rectangle and virtually unreadableusable on mobile	46				0
I really like that the user can move the boxes around with the five finger pinch. I would consider adding an option where the user can hold down the box for a certain amount of time and then the app is movable. Similar to iPhone apps.	46				0
i saw that a future feature will be to have users create multiple lists of blocked websites do you think this important feature should have its own button so remove out of settings i do agree that settings is a bit ambiguous and should be renamed	46				0
I see that you are going for a cheaper design with using all cardboard but I think you could still round out the design a bit more and add the skii mask band on the back and it would make for a much more ergonomic design.	46				0
I think this is a good problem to tackle. I believe a while back, the microsoft hololens was trying to hint at the possibility of being able to do what you are talking about so maybe AR could be an interesting path for you to consider.	46				0
I wish that there was a different way to interact with the yard scale than a game controller. I also wish that the watch had a different use case. maybe once you are at a location, the watch can give you an audio tour with headphones.	46				0
I'm assuming the colors are the different noise levels? I don't know if its super intuitive. Might be better to do light blue to dark blue or something? Are the checks available rooms? And are the times how much time is left before they are free?	46				0
In your task you say that the user would might just turn off the alarm instead of stretching and moving around. If you allow the user to choose between entering a password and dancing, I don't see anything preventing them from taking the lazy way out.	46				0
Love the ability to either stay at the current location or walk to a certain locaiton for a lower price. I think predefining the range (5-10 minute) walk and allowing the users to input a price range that they would like to pay would be helpful.	46				0
maybe its because you decided to keep the first page simple in which case consider the rubric item to be met but there is scope for many useful interactions to be afforded to the user on this page itself to avoid further clicks to get somewhere	46	1	1	1	3
obviously you need to make it more clear how the data are going to be generated the data side of things is an important feature too though lets just assume its all one interface where the users can access the data just as a scientist would	46				0
the point of view wanders between mental health and breaks in a way that does not bring them together so work on that if you decide to pursue this some of your points in isolation could have very well worked as your point of view though	46				0
Very nice UI! My only gripe is with the volume interface. Perhaps you can swipe it vertically instead of horizontally? That way if the user accidentally presses really hard or uses 2 fingers when they didn't mean to they won't be taken to the next screen.	46				0
Hotkeys are the main method I use. I'd love to be able to see parallel pages of notes and quickly move between the two. For me, setting up my notes can take a while so having the ability to quickly set up everything would also be ideal.	47				0
I like how there are clear directions given, however, what if they're traveling somewhere far away? How will all the many directions be made known to the user on the yard interface? Will they have an option to see all of the directions on the foot interface?	47				0

Not seeing a video link :( Curious to what your solution is though, if it's a reminder app how would it work to constantly remind the user to take a break? If it's an ergonomic hack, what separates this hack from other devices like an ergonomic keyboard/mouse?	47				0
protocol is straightforward and shows respect and concerns for your participants one thing i encourage is to allow your participants explore the app after they finish the task this will be a easy way to find any other bugs that you or your participants did not find	47				0

What is the interface? What is the input to the interface? What does the interface control? Neither of your pictures nor your description give a proper example. Is it a stylus? Are there motion captured cameras? How is this any different than a standard 4 -monitor setup?	47				0
also the doctors appointment setting is cool but there might be some design space left that we could explore other than that specific scenario maybe by adding extra functionality we might be able to attract users to check their health information more often outside the doctors appointment scenarios	48				0
Good idea to find a cheap way to let both the User and the Spectator have a deep experience with Holograms. I really like interface two because it is necessary for conference participants to choose avaible in booths around them. It gives them more freedom without extra Hololens.	48	1	1	1	3
good job extrapolating your observations of users of specific apps and platforms ie kakaotalk etc however some of the needs having different appsplatforms sounded similar to me and by collapsing them into a couple has led me to decide that the number of needs didnt meet the criterion	48				0
I really like the idea and would find this extremely useful. It seems like a very feasible project given todays technology, however it seems very similar to Google Lens as you mentioned. Besides being restricted to a more specific domain, how does it differ/provide a lead user tech?	48				0
If hololens is popular in the future, there may be lots of devices around the users. Therefore, I believe the system is hard to detect which the device user want connect. I wish you can add distance info and users can know which device is correct for connecting.	48				0
If Ryan is drawing on the Wacom that's in the center, I wonder if his arm or elbow will be resting on the surrounding screens, pressing random things in them. Maybe there should be a lock button for certain screens so he doesnt have to worry about that	48				0
interesting activity to observe i think there are design opportunities related to how people associate with each different website and thinking about the human factor involved in how people collect information and interact with it in the internet space might lead to some great ideas keep it up	48				0
It mind be a good idea to have the watch interface detect user's heart rate, and gives warning if the heart rate is above the danger threashold. Also, one suggestion is that it might be better to just have white color font over black background on the watch.	48				0
some of the pages of the prototype manifests a confusing flow of interaction for example what does the sign in and sign up button do what about the next button on the home screen how does it differ and how does signing in affect the flow of interaction	48				0
The outline reature is really interesting. I think having the ability to quickly see how your notes are organized is ideal for quick and orderly notes. I would also like to see the folder that the notes are organized in and the ability to switch between different lectures.	48				0
The produce, dairy, meat, could be removed and instead just cycle through all of the items initially (produce, dairy, etc. could be a sort method). It would make it easire to just see the items expiring soon since that's what your lead user expressed as the more important.	48				0
there is no way to navigate within the app back to the main screen from the placeholder wikipedia pages this makes navigation confusing within the app a better way to place a placeholder page would simply be a blank html page rather than redirecting to an external site	48				0
also what happens if there are multiple goals to achieve simultaneously is it that users have to manually divide whatever the financial gain they obtained into several groups and assign them to each goal the process of how users input the data other than creating the goals is missing	49				0
i know you guys mentioned that you were concerned about falling behind on your functionality so i recommend finding a way to either scale back by finding a different way to implement the core gameplay or finding a way to wizard some of the more customized components youre planning	49				0
i like the idea of bringing context to your health situation by using the information about your family members i think because the hospital visits could potentially be very rare and irregular it might be harder for the users of your service to form a habit out of it	49	1	1	1	3
I like the way you display the information about incomplete tasks using the Gantt style rather than just a list of things that need to be done. Something to consider is if there are a large number of things tasks for just one person, it might be too cluttered.	49				0
I think it would be good if puzzle solvers will have an way to solve puzzles on the wall versus on the ground, as it might be less tiring to look in a forward direction and think. Long time of staring to the ground can be bad for health.	49				0
i think these sorts of task competition type of apps only work well if a group of people are working towards the same goal as in the feedback for the previous prototype i think something that is missing from these sorts of task apps is the idea of accountability	49	0	0	0	0
interesting interface regarding how to prioritize tasks but you might also want to see how those initial priorities change over time it might be helpful to observe in heuristic evaluations how users interact with it assuming that days or weeks have passed since the tasks priority has been entered	49				0

The estimated time for the homework task does not make sense because it's hard to measure the time for each assignment. A same task may take an hour or two hours based on actual situation unless you have a good way to help users estimate the time for completion.	49	1	1	1	3
The Gap Time bar here seems a little un-emphasized in terms of what times she has gap hours. Sometimes when I'm checking my schedule, I just want to quickly see what my allotted time is. Maybe you can show how much time she has left in her gap instead?	49				0
This is a super cool idea!! I really like the idea of the detachable wacom tablet, kinda reminds me of the nintendo switch. I'm alittle confused on the other parts, it would be cool to have more detailed design in the upcoming assignments !! Overall Very good job :)	49				0
too much focus on the solution you already have an idea of what the game would look like which is contrary to the point of the assignment which is to only focus on the user needs point awarded because you justified the relevance of the activity to the brief	49	1	1	1	3
when you say uses like one page more than another is this just from their own selfreport the purpose of the ab test is not to ask users if they like a page but to see if their behavior within the page reveals that ie through button clicks etc	49				0
$20 is the original price without the surge right? If so, the box containing "$20" shouldn't be designed the same way as the +$7 and the others in that row. It should be in its own container and maybe bolded or a different color to distinguish it from other numbers.	50	1	1	0	2
also i heard that panoramio locr or flickr equally allow their users to upload geocoded pictures or to add geolocation information online using the exif format some of the newer cameras are equipped with the feature you might want to check out those and make a comparative analysis as well	50				0
As a smash player, i really like this idea !! When im at tournments, i can see myself using this application when im not at the venue. It would be also cool if theres more features on the applications. Features such as replay, highlights and kos. MANGO FOR LIFE <3	50				0
Definitely one of those high tech interfaces ! I love how it directs to you on the foot design. I think it is extremely cool!. I think for the watch interface, maybe add colors or symbols to show what pages are you on. I got confused on which is which.	50				0
I think it might be better to just have how many days left with noticeable numbers on each application versus a progressing bar like thing. For companies that has rolling policy, then you can add the start date and notify user to fill in the applicaion as soon as possible	50				0
It would be great to have some icon to distinguish the Delay, Ambience, Reverb, etc. part since it makes it easier for user to identify the one they want to control. Similarly, for the violin, Drum, Harp, etc at the button, it would better to replace the word with pictures.	50				0
On the tablet, I tried something similar to a relax list before, and I find that if I wanted to do something I just do it. Maybe something could be added onto this to specify what I *should* do to relax, whether than provide a list of possible relaxing tasks.	50				0
QR Code is a creative addition! However, QR codes tend not to be very common among users (Klemmer has some knowledge regarding this). Would your user really know how to work with a QR code? Would she rather just input her phone number and have the info texted to her?	50				0
Something that's bugging me is this: Will the user actually care about how much time they've saved? In my opinion, it's not something that will inherently mean anything to them. If you really think it's crucial, maybe the time saved could be displayed more functionally? Perhaps as a progress bar?	50				0
what i see from all three storyboards is essentially the same an easy contact info resume sharing interface using a smart watch what we want to try here is not only to imagine variations in user scenarios but also to look for very different angles of solving the same problem	50				0
I love how you can select the teams' logos, however it doesn't seem to be well-aligned with your grid. I suggest drawing out a plain square, matching it to the grid, and then have your logo align with the square, so you can see how much space is being taken up.	51				0
i need to be able to see a history of my own recycling vs garbage you can just make a table for each category try simulating using a post that another user has made instead of making a new post for each item that way its more community driven and convergent	51				0
interesting activity i think it could have been interesting to experiment whether or not the subjects immediately visit their facebook account to dig up their memories from the past when asked show me one of your memories from year 2012 instead of requiring them to use facebook in the first place	51				0
it is unclear what the exact quantifiable measure you will be testing is a more concrete explanation would be to say that you are testing for example different add member buttons in your group page to test whether users understand the purpose of the page and add members to the group	51				0
Love your idea !! It would be super cool if this can not only be like a school supply interface, it would be cool to use as a party hosting app. For example, users can use this interface to keep in track whos bringing what and who bought what item. Etc.	51				0
Love your idea, sometimes i hate to look down on my tablet and look up to look at my computer screens. I also like how this idea is very futureistic, im alittle confused on the other panels. What can they do ? Can they be on the wacom as well ?	51				0
Maybe you can add a function that put a corresponding track on the transcripts when the users are writing notes since the transcritp is long. Sometimes I forget which line I need to track and take me a long time to find what I currently focus on after writing the notes.	51				0
the app is looking great i like how the icon corresponds with the app name blockit make sure to show off the icon and more importantly show the name of your app on all screens i also like the pug rolling aroundso cute i see what youre trying to do hahah	51				0
the video is 54 seconds long and only shows a limited scenario the aspect of people coming back to hobbying after some time and how this app can help them to pull some valuable insights out of the collected information as you stated in the pov isnt shown in the video	51				0
collaborative budgeting is interesting but think about why people would care how their friends are budgeting or care about a garden a way to pivot might be to think about collaborative goalbased budgeting where groups can budget for a collective goal that might be more motivating for people to stay on task	52				0
For the tablet scale, if the user needs to follow the steps in order, you can present one at a time. Once it has been sufficiently completed as informed by the (assumed) sensors on their clotings, then show the next step (you can still show "step 1 out of 4" for progress).	52				0
i could not reward you a point because there are some dead links for example dead links my projects in the menu button leads to a broken file links to publications of collaborator list of collaborators records of presentation and help john help you in the project description should all be implemented	52	1	1	1	3
i may have found a slight bug area of confusion in your navigation after clicking on edit for a task and then pressing the back button in the navbar i was expecting to go back to runpage but was instead navigated to taskscreen an additional back click brought me to the runpage	52				0
im curious to know how does having inaccuracy and invalidity involved in her fitness blog affect her i notice that she modifies the description of corresponding picture to make her blog look more attractive to public and this modification of personal events and data lead to inaccuracy and invalidity to her history	52				0
Instead of using a white fill for the restaurant options, use a black fill, red border, and red text. But for the selected restaurant, use a white fill, red border, and red text. This makes the non-selected restaurants "fade" into the already black background, and increases the contrast of the selected restaurant.	52				0
ok I think I see now, after like 3 minutes of staring at it It is not clear that there are YouTube videos in the screen like I did not get that the user task was they can use the TV to open a YouTube video for some perhaps an instructional video	52				0
Really love how the design turned out! It's clear and easy to distinguish what are what. I love how everything is in order ! However, it would be nice to have some other thing on the watch interface because i feel like puzzle 1 can be alittle hard to read on it.	52	1	1	1	3
the app looks really good compared to how i last saw it good job on the progress the app looks very polished and has a very consistent style the interactions that your team planned created are all translating properly i encountered one minor and major bug both noted at the other rubric	52				0
There isn't really much I can see since I cannot see your design. But I am really really expected to see how your idea would work out because I think it is a real issue that people need to be worried about and I am long time seeking for solution for this.	52	1	1	1	3
Using a character with a lower ASCII value than an alphabetical character is quite the life hack - I myself use file-naming conventions when organizing directories of broadcast packages. I place a 0 before the name of the most recent package, so it is always listed at the top upon directory navigation.	52				0
Viewing the news or getting recommendaitons on new places to explore through social media is a great idea because I also symphathize with your user. News sites offer very little user input in their articles which makes it hard to get a good idea of just how impactful the article/situation can be.	52	1	1	1	3
At the yard scale, I like the ability to play an interactive game. I think having some simple morning workouts would be an interesting interaction (pushups, situps, etc.) as well. This would definitely get my blood pumping and combined with the morning playlist, I would find it extremely hard to fall back asleep.	53				0
Awesome design, it looks incredibly neat and effective. I love what you guys did with the colors, i feel like its very coordinated. However, its a little hard to read for the yellow text. Maybe changing a darker color could solve the problem. I also love the contrast between dark blue and white.	53				0
for example one can think that networking can be made more efficient if the applicants had more information about the pool of applicants or how their skill set compares to what the recruiters are looking for and therefore they can selectively apply to positions that they have a fair chance of getting in	53				0
i like how clean your app is it still has some bugs so please make sure to fix those before user testing i still wish that there were images of the food items and restaurant also remember to add a label for your filtering as that might confuse your users overall great job	53				0
I love the idea of allowing the user to go on the most efficient route in any grocery store. One of the problems I see often are a lot of people get lost when they go into a grocery store they've never been to before. I love how this app addresses that problem!	53				0
I really like the design of how this app is set up, but one thing I'd mention is to be cognisant of the colors you choose. It's not too clear what each color represents, and they should be consistent across interfaces (red for bad, orange for ok, yellow for mild, green for good?)	53				0
I'm not sure the user needs the name of the types of waves being blocked. Also I think sound waves are all one type so I'm not sure what the purpose of have types of waves is. Even waves of the same type can have different sound qualities and different counter sounds needed	53				0
In your remianing requriments setion, I wish you could list all the courses relative to that topic rather than just giving the category, because students may want to see what classes they need to take excatly. Most of them they don't know what classes are under that category. Make the section more intuitive.	53	1	1	1	3
it seems a bit odd to me that so many more users were on the card than the page i dont think this necessarily skewed your results but its something to consider given that 24 users visited the card on one day whereas the page only got 5 users total over all days	53				0
it would be beneficial to look at how users actually use the app if consolidating the fragmented information related to your hobby into one place and therefore letting the users manage or track their hobby statuses easier is the goal of the app i think that goal isnt evident in the current design	53				0
pg 3 and 4 give me the idea of having a general platform for scientists to put out simple surveysor even citizens this would include citizens in the scientific process they could design their own surveys and publish their results all within the app consider going this route if you like the idea	53				0
Rather than the players having to manually input the scores, it would be cool if the game automatically sent the scores to the interface which updates itself. Maybe at the start of the game when it sees the player, it can scan the phone & controller too and know which scores to update.	53				0
The hole is only for one direction. However, if you want to clean the entire sink, you need to open hole in all the directions. It may reduce the power of water stream because you need to open many holes. Probabaly you can come up some ideas to solve the problem of directions.	53	1	1	1	3
comparison was supposed to be made at the violation level you confused this with the reflection part this applies to the next rubric item the length reduces its usefulness at the very least break it up into separate paragraphs talk more about the brief how did they compare in actually meeting the design objective	54				0
Going off from the idea of voice control, instead of just showing visual information when user asked questions, it might also be a good idea to give audio feedback: for example, have the headset as a tour guide to explain the background of this picture or explain the things that might insterest the user.	54				0
How are the 3D models just floating alongside the tablet? What allows a floating object to become a monitor object? Where do the announcements come from? In addition, it was explicitly stated that allowing for an editable interface (translatable and scaleable interface elements) was not allowed, or a "cop-out" from an actual interface design.	54				0
I don't think it is a good idea to "enter" the number of reps for a specific workout on the watch size design. Why don't have it to be a good default that would most like fit the user, and give them couple like two or three other choices to customize a little bit.	54				0
I like the contents you've showed in your video because they are all relevant to the information that user need to get his/her day started. However, I would like to see more information like for example the suggested clothing style for today based on the weather and the change of temperature in a day.	54	1	1	1	3
I like the idea that people needs a better way to remind him to balance their use of time in school works and video games (and smartphones!!) So I hope this application can be extended to not just video games but all different type of electronic devices that can interrupt our focus on studdy.	54				0
I think it would be cool if people could work remotely on the whiteboard. Maybe it could be a smart board that syncs up with computers/tablets and whatever is written on there is also translated onto the white board. I think this might be a good way to add pictures and stuff as well.	54				0
If you decide to keep all the text, try to highlight some lines of text to indicate possible solutions, maybe use green? If I was a user, I feel like I would just skim over the information about how the mechanics work, and primarily look for a solution to fix my specific car problem.	54				0
Maybe you can come up a good interface on tablent that transform paper to digital because people tend to use digital device to mark their note. At the same time, you can refer to your lead user's method to set the format for users' and help them write note in clean and clear way.	54	1	1	1	3
One thing that concerns me is that Jeff will spend too much time in bed and still end up being late to class/work. YouTube videos can get lengthy and it can also sometimes put people to sleep. Maybe it can display what his friends are up to on his favorite social media accounts instead.	54				0
the idea is creative and interesting i like the idea of bringing the community of students together to make a positive impact however a number of students in our studio noted that the application may seem too negative if you are struggling with thinking of an idea feel free to come to office hours	54				0
The layout for the foot interface is a bit cluttered. It's better to have one main category or one format and combine other elemtent together. Maybe you can use the calendar as the main method to display all the assignment. When the users click the element inside the caledar, other inteface can pop out.	54				0
The task seems to be tied to a different lead user, not Timmy himself. Timmy is more of an average user - as he did not himself modify the stadium seating with an interface. How did Timmy's specific need drive this innovation? Is he having a hard time watching or interacting with the crowd?	54				0
For the Yard display (the one in your third video, might be foot scale, but it looks like the interface is larger than the one in the second video.), I can see that you can select media and the content to read. But there is just so many pixels for your to make use of.	55				0
Good work ! A simple design yet it can be extremely useful. I really like the simplicity, it brings out the aesthetics. However, it would be nice to have some sort of indication of whats going. As a first time user, its a little hard to keep in track what is going on and stuff.	55				0
How cheap would your design be? You could get a cheap graphics tablet for about $15 online. Granted, it wouldn't have all the fancy features of a Wacom tablet but if your user's only goal is to be able to write on the screen more comfortably, then maybe a $15 tablet would do the trick.	55				0
I believe in the lower part of the foot design, there are controls crowds with each other. When since the foot size is not that big and the the dail on the lower part is relatively small, it is harder to perform a turning gesture and also easily touch the slide bar at the button.	55				0
I feel like getting the correct dance move can be stressful. Maybe adjust the types of activities the user can do. Last thing I want to do is dance in my office where people are looking. I'm not sure how the leaderboard is relevant. I wouldn't really care about how well other people are doing.	55				0
I like that the visual design is clear and there is not much clutter on the screen. I wish there were more options for choosing shoes since they have aesthetic value. Here's how: for the shoe buying part on the foot scale, you could consider having comparisons or allowing people to change colors for shoes.	55				0
I love this idea, especially it can automatically record my expenses according to current location. Because for most of people, they have a stable routine. They go to several stable locatoins and spend money. In this app, people do not need to enter repeated information when they record expenses. It is very helpful and conveinent.	55	1	1	1	3
I think the watch is too complicated. For someone who is in the middle of singing, they would just want the stop start options. The tablet is what the user would want, and if there is too much electricity in the recording room to have it wouldnt your yard scale be a huge problem then?	55				0
I thinnk this is a good direction, it would be great to gather some feedback from your friends or family and see how then input data into their calendar and seeing how each person differs. I know in my experience, people can be vastly different and to some their calendar truly is a life organizer.	55				0
Overall, I really like the idea. I just think including more visual cues would make it better, instead of relying so heavily on textual information. More cues that make it easier to glancce at the fridge or freezer and know exactly what is expiring soon and what needs to be replaced in a timely manner.	55				0
the first prototype seems like a great idea for collaboration among students perhaps dig deeper in how to further strengthen this idea how can this application help the community of users to focus on their studies do students want to schedule meet up times to study together another note how is this different than piazza	55				0
Foot: I am not entirely sure when this scale is used since the user is either on their way to class or already in the classroom. If the user is rushing to class he/she will not be able to look at an ipad and if they are in the lecture they no longer need its funcitonality.	56				0
For the inch, I don't understand why Thomas has to even touch the screen. The new ios has the "hey siri" feature which would just automatically activate siri. I don't really see why he needs to even touch his watch. Other products like google home and alexa allow you to give commands using just your voice.	56				0
For the yard design, again try to use colors or some other mechanism to show the status of the washing machines/dryers (starting out shaded and becoming white as they finish completion, sort of like sands in an hourglass), as well as probably identifying the time slots of anyone who's standing near the display with different colors	56				0
i like the idea of your applicationespecially the upvoting system as that would increase the validity of the notes i recommend your team to look into incentivizing users to submit notes i reckon that many would probably use your appbut lurk more than contribute perhaps look into a reward system gamification to increase participation and submission	56				0
im not sure how you would measure users deciding to go to their profile page or not on the first visit you would need to process the data obtained from analytics and that may not be trivialpossible also usually more pathways to a page lead to greater discoverability so this is a weak test per se	56				0
Visual hierarchy is a bit unclear; I'm not sure what the user should be looking at first. To solve for this, maybe you could increase the font size of the titles for each card, since decisions are based off the data on them. This makes the cards more salient and creates more of a visual hierarchy.	56				0
also you might want to observe the entire process of networking using this interface assuming its at a career fair for example how would the recruiters use the collected information later would having a simple list of peoples contact information at one place actually reduce the amount of work for the recruiters or streamline their workflow better	57				0
although i dont think this breakdown was necessarily automatically inferable from the observation you made i particularly thought this breakdown was interesting the breakdown from this is the fact that the tool he uses excel only shows his spendings and does not show the amount of money he saved from various decisions he made throughout the week	57				0
Definitely Love the design !! Good job. I like how the design is simple but yet its very easy to know whats going on. As a new time user, i find it a little hard time figuring out what is the "bet" page. Is there anyway to have some sort of instructions on the app itself ?	57				0
great job minimizing the home tasks page on the home tasks page i recommend adding more widgets for gathering data like sliders or radio buttons that you can gather from then display simply on the personal and community pages you can make an intricate wireframe to put underneath the widgets to wizard of oz more data functionality	57				0
Hmm, Interesting. I use coursera myself, and could see myself using it. However, one question: Inorder to use this board, students and teachers must buy it ? Or is it like an interface that it can project on to your device. I think it would be cool to have something like this on an ipad, or computer.	57				0
I like that this design is a one-stop place for planning things like retreats with friends. It would be cool to be able to handle money straight from the design too (like a Venmo API or something LOL). Something else to consider is having different views/filtered information for organizers vs participants (depending on the type of group).	57				0
i like this idea because it takes something people think of as trivial and turns applies it to a situation where real emergencies happen one thing to think more about is how might this actually translate to real life how might you encourage people to actually build their own kit or understand what to do in emergencies	57	1	1	1	3
I think it is interesting to be able to pick classes for the year and then see when they are available per quarter but I also feel like it is easier to do it per quarter. Or see all possible choices that can count towards my requirements and show the different options per quarter for that year.	57				0
if you were planning to count the number of clicks on the chat button to gauge how much more people engage in conversation with others theres one caveat mainly that clicking on the chat button itself doesnt necessarily mean actual chatting ie message exchange rephrase it as how much more do users click the chat button instead	57	1	0	1	2
Since I could not get much information from your video, i really don't know how to provide feedbacks for your design. However, I can give you some hint on how I would implement such three interfaces if I wanted to help you or Jason to stay up to date with his favorite publications and blogs. See Below:	57				0
The button that the user has to press when finished with planning doesn't really stand out as an action button. It also doesn't have any words to communicate what it does. I would suggest making it more salient, moving it to bottom right (where buttons mostly are for moving forward), and adding a word label to it.	57				0
I really like how the app is laid out, it's very clean and easy to see the nearby attractions around you. One thing that would be nice to add is perhaps the map if you plan such a trip/iternary so you can see the exact route to take (or an option to export this to a Maps application)	58				0
the first wireframe is ok but the second wireframe doesnt seem like core functionality at all you would benefit from wireframing your core functionality like this in other words the actual contribution and data pages wireframe two looks like it might be for collecting data but i dont see that anywhere close to not giving point for this	58				0
you mentioned that time spent on the original version was greater than time spent on the new version but you didnt do a statistical test for this you would need to conduct a ttest on the mean time spent on each menu to correctly conclude that there is a significant difference in time spent on the two pages	58				0
you should mention specifically how this pov influences the prototype design some general feedback for the app make sure that its very clear what the purpose of the app is and differentiate it from a regular drawing app make it clear how and why this app will aid in lucid dreaming why is lucid dreaming important or beneficial	58				0
your pov doesnt quite explicitly mention a core problem but i kind of understand what you mean i would suggest making your pov a bit more concrete next timeeg potential diners often have a difficult time choosing a place to eat because they have trouble filtering through the information they receive from multiple sources apps peers reviews etc	58	1	1	1	3
Clever usage of colors and shapes to indicate the overall progress, but is this really indicative of a game? Yes, people who like a certain team tend to stick together, but what if there aren't that many fans of one team in the stadium as opposed to the home team? How would this app account for a disproportionate ratio?	59				0
For the yard, I think a more visual calendar-esque design would be better suited for this. It takes more work to read through all of the times and descriptions. You said Thomas likes to be able to do things fast so I think a calendar would allow him to scan through not only today's to-do list but also tomorrows.	59				0
Having the watch connected to your heart rate is a great idea as its pretty telling if you're up and active or just falling back asleep. I think just having a haptic buzzing response would suffice as well. For example, removing the snooze button altogether and just have the watch buzz until your heart rate reaches a minimum bpm.	59				0
i think brainstorming and reiterating your current designs at this stage is crucial to achieving a successful project at the end please revisit the feedback you received during the studio on friday and come to my office hour or request one if you cant make it on thursdays from 1100 1200 if you need someone to brainstorm with you	59				0
I think that there is a lot of unused space on the main interface and a lot of information being displayed that isn't necessarily pertinant all the time. An example would be the food list preview, it is unlikely it shows what im looking for and I would more likely go view the whole list than just the preview.	59				0
Inch: I do not understand the purpose of the first screen but I believe the user alreayd knows where their class is so the second screen does not need half of it to be devoted ot the name of the lecture hall. Instead try enlarging the names so they are easier to click on for directions to the user.	59				0
the workout summary page doesnt have a design also some elements such as sign out which should look different from the page title other than just color indicating its a link appear cut out im using galaxy s5 as the device in chromes responsive mode let me know if you prefer something else or fix it for this config	59				0
Yard: I like the idea of comparing mutual friends with someone at the yard scale. I think it would be more beneficial to show both people's schedules and where they overlap as well as mutual friends within each class. Sometimes you may not know you have friends in a class until the end because of the large sized classroooms.	59	1	1	1	3
Because this interface will be appeared on the tablet or computer, maybe you can add a section that can modulate the lighting ambience. Sometimes some events are real-time performance. Users need to make sure that the control is correct before actually turning the machine. Therefore, haveing a section that allows users to preview the result can prevent errors from happening.	60	1	1	1	3
I know in class you talked about turning this into an API and using it on top of google docs, this seems like a great idea to me. Google docs has a lot of great features but some of them can be a bit annoying and adding functionality to quickly and effectively take notes would be useful for any student.	60				0
YARD SCALE 1) For the 2nd column, either the items or locations should be highlighted. Whichever you think is more important. 2) There are conflicting points of interest. I'm not sure if I should be paying attention to the large image on the right first, or if I should be paying more attention to the images on the left first.	60				0
your ab test does not appear to be quantifiable because it does not seem like google analytics is able to track the described behavior i dont think itd be possible to quantify the order of actions the user takes however you can still ab test the button to see if users presented with this screen would click the button more	60	1	1	1	3
although the prototype provides four different categories books movies music fitness it only shows how the book interface might look like the book interface might not be exactly extensible to other categories such as music or fitness can you define checklists for listening to music for example wouldnt the span of the activity be a lot shorter than reading a book	61				0
good job getting the selection screen on the upload but it doesnt upload after that it might be nice to implement a camera api for users to take a picture directly in the app but this is a lower priority than getting the upload to work correctly also the like button is only available for the first image of the homepage	61	1	1	0	2
I really like that the upgrade does not change the simplicity of VIM. I am able to transition to your upgrade and still feel comfortable using VIM. I see a problem in other applications that change the UI so much that it is like having to learn a new interface all over again. I really appreicate that you keep it familiar.	61				0
Inspired by lead user's creative way, you can come up with default note sections for users to mark down their notes. In your example, it's important to think about how to organize graphs and words and make interface more intuitive, clean and clear. Espeically, when students want to review their notes, they can easily access what they want quickly without confusing.	61				0
Reconsider your task and user - find some specfic problem that can be solved with the design you come up with, based on those found needs. To me, it seems that you just photoshopped your ideal workstation. How is the interface controlled? How do I move the widowmaker? How many CPUs are being used to power this interface? How many displays?	61				0
since the point has been docked in a related rubric item you dont lose it here as the implementation is true to the wireframe but that means you still have to work on this from the perspective of the overall project as a 4member team our expectations are definitely higher in some aspect be it design chops user research or implementation	61				0
Changes to the expiration bar would also be helpful. For example, like we talked in class about how different items expire at differnet rates. So visually, how would you display that? Maybe showing text about how quickly the item will expire relative to the other items so the user is confident in having the ability to quickly or slowly eat the item	62				0
I really like the idea of this because I often forget what I am buying at the grocery store. Not sure how I like the taps at the top of the foot interface, I would recommend having them at the left side maybe? I like the deals based on your shopping list feature because it's nice knowing that I am saving money.	62	1	1	1	3
INCH SCALE 1) On the 1st screen, the buttons are too close and too small. This could be difficult for the user to interact with; slips could occur! As designers we should try to design interfaces to reduce the amount of slips and mistakes :) 2) There is too much text on the 2nd screen. Try to make the information more concise.	62				0
Love the sparse interface! Only issue I have is, what is the platform this interface will be used on? If it's a tablet, then I think it would work well. However, if it's something like a watch that you can slap (that Scott had recommended a couple of weeks prior), then maybe the reset and end buttons aren't in the best places.	62				0
Oh Boy! These interfaces are going to drive me crazy everytime i wake up in the morning. I love the idea and how the interface turned out. However, i personally feel like i wouldn't use it because of the complication. I get the idea and such but to me, it's a little hard and perfer to have normal alarm on my phone.	62	1	1	1	3
so youve been good for a while but you now need to start fleshing it out more i want to see more data analysis and interpretation beyond just the classification location data maybe show the data to the user what other kinds of data can you collect maybe you can give the user plants to try to find like a quest woahhh	62				0
some of the needs sound conflicting from the observation this nap can range from 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on how tired he is but if it helps him work better afterwards it may be worth the time and reebal needs a way to organize his day better so he does not have to take a nap before getting to work	62				0
the garden component wasnt that wellhighlighted in the video i think that is your most important part as thats the part that relates to the collaborative and collective pov youre taking with your app the input of information is also important but i think more focus on the garden component and what users can do with the garden would be more important	62				0
the only thing i would critique is that you gave a task to each of your participants while this will be good when it comes to user testing the purpose of needfinding is to observe people doing something in their everyday life which is presumably not just writing sequential numbers i think the concept of the activity is on the right track	62				0
At the watch scale, I'm curious how you got to the 'double cheese burger' in the first place? Does it swipe through a few different options first? It could be interesting to see the most popular item being eaten or possible something you have ordered in the past. As it would be hard to start a completly new order on the watch scale.	63				0
Great Work! I can definitely see this as an application. Users can just put down what they spent throughout the month and the application will telly up that information and form a chart of some kind. Then it will tell users how effecient they are throughout the month. This interface can be used by wide variety of people. From college students to Adults.	63				0
I think the lightbulb icons should be able to indicate if the lights are on or off. The light bulbs should be yellow for on and gray for off so that Drew can just scan over the screen and know what is off and on. He should also be able to just tap on the light bulb to turn that particular room off.	63				0
its unclear what you mean by inaccurate search function does this mean their search function gets things wrong you go on to say that they assume the user knows what they are searching for in which case the search function would maybe be insufficient or noncomprehensive which would be different from inaccurate also no thoughts about heuristic evaluation overall included in this paragraph	63				0
Love the design, its very imformative. I'm able to know whats going on and what to do. I like how simple it is, i think thats the reason why it is easy to understand. I also like the square interface on the main interface. Overall Good job !! I wish that maybe less new screens, i know theres alot of screens going on.	63				0
Love the idea of changing up how students takes notes. There are a lot of different methods such as bullet journaling and every students has their own variation. I know Klemmer doesn't want a lot of customization for this assignment but note taking methods can be very personal so maybe having a few popular preset options would be good for multiple different users?	63				0
needs and solutions are different timeline has a very specific form of interface and is referred to as a solution in the following statements people need a social timeline where they can post all format of history like words photographs videos etc people need a social timeline that keeps the timeline structure yet still able to search and rank according to the sic	63				0
Perhaps one thing you can do to fix this is to use more visual based brain teasers so that he doesn't really have to read. Because if I have a hard time waking up in the morning, I would have an even more difficult time trying to read tiny text and I might just not even bother with it and go to sleep.	63				0
the interaction demonstrated is limited the video prototype doesnt show much of direct manipulation of the interface it couldve been better if the scenario it demonstrated was filmed in the firstperson perspective as it obviates the need for any unrealistic assumption such as listening to and looking at someone elses workout graph one gets motivated to work out and start using the app	63				0
Currently, I think there are too many sections on the screen at a time. Most of the cases, I would not use all of them. Maybe the system can be smarter to detect which section the users would use while other sections they would not use and close them automatically. Or you can let the users to choose to close or open the sections.	64				0
For the kitchen part, I wish you can improve the control. The users' freedom is limited because you only provide the choice of even row or odd row. Moreover, because when you leave home, you probably do not want to leave any of that on because of security issue. For this term, you can just have one button to turn off all the elements.	64				0
Great idea! I definitely think you could work in an app (perhaps on the watch) that knows where you want to go, and then tells you what bus/bus stop to take, as well as directions/distance to the bus stop. It's much nicer than needing to rely on 3 different applications, especially on a mobile phone where multitask isn't enough and limits functionality a lot	64				0
I love the design, based off from your persona. I can tell that your visual design will definitely help your grandpa. It's very clear and informative. I'm able to pick up whats what by the symbols. However, it would be nicer to have a proper interface instead of a drawing interface. I think you can bring your design to a far better potential !	64				0
Since your main task is to help video gamers balance their time for school and for games. I don't see how the progress chart can help user to achieve that goal. They might want to check their sleep duration and quality but and I think the most important idea is that they need a way to interrupt them from gaming when they need to.	64				0
Another idea for your task is to allow students to post their work online and add some descriptions. Buyers can search and look for the one they like. For this idea, buyers don't have to wait for answers and reply and get what they want immediatly. It is helpful for buyers who have plants already and want to get the pot as soon as possible.	65				0
Another is that they need a really simple, fast and intuitive interface for them to select what type of situation it is. For example, if it is a watch interface, right before the EMT people is about to send message through watch, the watch should already give a smart guess of current situtation, whether it be gunfire or explosion, based on the ambient sound around.	65				0
For the inch scale, it's not clear that the exhibit and panel options are the things you have added to your list. It initially looks like it would contain the entire list of exhibits and panels. Also, is it important to distinguish panels from exhibits on the watch? They're all events to the user. You may want to just show the time and display both	65				0
I feel like there are too many colors involved in the first page. If the purpose is to have them go from highest importance to lowest importance the colors should flow better, the difference between the blues, as well as the orange is a bit harsh. Also the light blue draws more attention than the yellow and orange which is probably not what you want.	65				0
i felt like this reflection paragraph focused too much on the type of menu in the prototype i would have liked to also see some mention of the how well the system matched with the real world in terms of their icons and more about how the prototype handled errors point awarded because you did address your findings good insights about the subjectivity of hes	65				0
I wish you could focus more on the layout of the text, maps and images. Because the glasses is small, you need to make sure that the users will not be overwhelm by lots of the information just in front of their eyes. Therefore, it is better to categorize information by meaning or topics or types and create a cleaner and clearer AR glasses interface.	65				0
Its a great application and i can see many people use this app. However, personally, i wouldnt really use this because i feel like everyone is just going to randomly throw their arms out. I doubt everyone in the stadium is going to have an useful application like this to guide their wave. If everyone had this application, i think it would be perfect !!!	65				0
treat the user less like a subject i see how youve incentivized contributing sleep data by having these extra features that simultaneously provide data of the users and these useful features that the user will use the issue is why these data are important what are the questions you are asking why are these questions unanswerable to scientists and how does this app help that	65				0
Yard: I like the idea of seeing mutual friends in the class but I feel like the cloud with names in it is a bit messy and makes it difficult when searching through and seeing who is in your class. I would change this to different levels such as friends synced from phone contacts to friends on facebook to mutual friends on facebook or something?	65				0
4) The "Number of people" should be above the number line interface because the line itself is not salient enough to catch my attention before reading the "Number of People." Or you could make the number line more salient by adding color or increasing its size. The estimated wait time should also be more salient because I think it's the most important information on the page.	66				0
Currently, primary you are using th voice guidance in your project. I wish you could think about the scenerio if the users are unable to understand what the AR say and want to read the word information. Because the glasses is very small, it's hard to put too many words on the glasses. Maybe you could create another device if the users want to learn more.	66				0
For the Yard size display, I would imagine it to be a display in front of a bus stop, so that when people are waiting for the bus to come, they can read about some breaking news happening right now on the public display. And the public display could also show some bus information so that the readers are informed about when the bus will come.	66				0
good job on this weeks assignment the development is well thought out however the tasks can be made more specific and actionable split of some tasks to make them more specific instead of code homepage createedit groups push notifications button menu button write implement functionality of create and edit groups buttons on the home page etc for next week update your plan to include these changes	66				0
great job i like the idea of tying places with memories also letting you create your own map of meaningful locations is novel this might be a little tangential but you might also want to think about what it means have different users different collections of memories there might be an interesting design space to map a location to different peoples different lives ideas and moments	66				0
i could not reward you the point because of dead ends and dead links for example dead end when i click the remind button on a task it redirects me to the remind page that does not have a back button back to the task page for example dead links the home and create groups in the menu button of tasks 1 6 do not work	66				0
I'm just worried about the effectiveness at the end. The pressure remains high when the hole just opens but unless you have large balloon, the water will become smaller after a few seconds. In order to clean the sink with powerful water stream, he may need to do it for several times. It's annoying. Probably you can come up some good idea to reduce the effort.	66				0
I'm not really into baseball, so my opinions can be extremely bias. However, i really like the idea of this application, i think not only can this work on a baseball field, you can expand it to other sports. I personally wouldnt use this because i dont really go to baseball games, but it also has the potential for other games. Games like basketball and soccer	66				0
Love this idea ! It's like a much superior version of the yelp. This is definitely going to help users who are having trouble with a new city and they want to go out and explore. Maybe add some unique functions such as if you take a photo of something, then a pop up will appear and explain that photo. Just to make it more uniqueness	66				0
nice video and thorough evaluation i like this idea of using a task app to help teams better delegate and complete work this accountability structure is unique and i think you can do a lot with it going forward think more about this concept of accountability and how you can utilize positive and negative reinforcement through the app to encourage people to complete their delegated tasks	66				0
your weather page is blank the useful and funny buttons for the reviews dont really do anything also mapsurf has empty slightly crowded crowded buttons they dont immediately update the current status i figured out later that its based on votes but thats not very obvious provide feedback to the user abut the number of votes as of now it just appears to be a bug	66				0
4) It would be useful if, on the yard scale, there was an overview or summary of what the user had input on his ticket. Instead of having many scattered elements on the screen, maybe a pop-up with information like: table #, bar or table, wait time, # of people, and pending. This way, the interaction would be quick, reducing the potential for crowding at the T.V.	67				0
great work managing to conduct diary studies but too bad that this was not complete i can definitely see the effort but due to the nature of the study it would have been better if observation was collected for a longer period of time not one day it would be great to have such results leading to need statements but compiling them will also require extra effort	67				0
i can see myself using this application. I feel like now days, its so hard to keep tracks of applications. This interface can definitely solve the problem. The one thing that i might suggest is to see the competitor in the market, i feel like theres alot of application interface like this. It would be cool to have your own unique features . Overall, great job :)	67				0
although the number of items presented meets the criterion 15 needs some of the presented needs are weakly connected to the activity observation in my opinion specifically the following is the excerpt that includes the term bank 1 he took out his i phone and opened the bank app trying to recall when is the last time he had used his card by looking at the transaction record	68				0
Are there any particular hacks that this user uses when inputting data into her calendar? I know for me, I usually record my schedule on a piece of paper as I am told about the data then later input it into my calendar manually. I think it would be interesting to see a couple different interfaces for inputting data and then translating that into the traditional calendar view.	68				0
In terms of the alighment of visual design, I think you could better think of the way to maximize the use of the "field of view" of Human eye, which is an essential topic in the AR/VR development. Even though there could be infinite number of pixels for you to use in VR, there are still limited amount of information that people can see without rotating their heads.	68				0
lastly make sure to keep nielsens heuristics in mind i was able to add an empty task which shouldnt happen make sure to add error prevention messages also make sure to add in messages to show that there are currently no task n their to do to promote the users to add a task and no tasks in their history when they are indeed empty overall great job	68				0
Love the desgin!!! I like how you used red and blue to stand out each players on the team. I also love how simple the interface is, i think that this is very well designed. It would also cool if theres picture for each character, i know mango and armada are very famous in the community, but for people who are not famous, pictures can really help them.	68				0
The tablet scale is interesting and I have already seen restaurants implementing this, such as at 'stacked'. I would normally use it in the restaurant so the function for pick-up time wouldn't really work if you were at the restaurant already. Also, when you begin to pick the foods, having the main or popular meals appear first would make it for an easier ordering experience on the tablet.	68				0
Good idea to find suitable and unique plant pots in this way rather than just using online shops. Compared with traditional online stores, this one allows users to freely express their needs. However, the disadvantage is the number of "student's reply" may not satisfy users' needs because students share their products individually but online stores are supported by a big company. They are able to provide users more choices.	69				0
Hm, very interesting idea. I could see myself using this, it is efficent and simple. However, i know this filling out can be quiet bothersome to some people. I think people would rather ask each other on the phone than doing something like this, i could be wrong though! However, it is something that could be very useful to me and i would definitely use it. Great job !	69				0
i like the concept of the analogy of a pets health to reallife health an interesting avenue i think you can go with this is how can you use this as a health tracker in addition to a diet tracker many diet tracking apps focus mainly on the dietfitness aspects without really taking into account health or mood you could potentially add something to this space in that direction	69				0
I like the Earth view for being able to check out places. That being said, I think that for your use case it is incorrect. For a use case that would be a user exploring places to potentially check out or visit, this would be ideal. However, if I already know I want to find places in Greece, I shouldn't have many other options taking up screen real estate.	69				0
its great that you tied each user action with a specific need its good to be elaborate in general however for the purposes of this assignment you didnt really need to tie those together in the user needs section you only needed to mention the needs as standalone the fact that they are informed by user actions and behavior is implied by your prior observations either way great job	69				0
taboo tho 1 is hard to read dont submit things like that in the future fair warning see lis model to explore multifaceted approach out of taboo design space also see how you might focus on different stages such as preparation reflection and action i like in 2 how the message is fairly personalized and more reflective almost like someone wrote the message for him after examining his day	69				0
The inference you're making about the most important aspect of a user's decision on which hostel to pick is its location relative to their points of interest, could be a bit of a stretch. for example, for me price was usually a bigger factor, especially in cities with public transportation. I would do a little exploration into what drives people to choose certain hostels over others in different scenarios.	69				0
There are too many options, which can also lead to content overload. Too many options can lead the user to not make a choice at all. It's confusing that there are 3 "Submit an answer" buttons, are they all the same thing? If so, then you should try to reduce them down to 1 (is it really necessary to see 3 "Submit and Answer" and 2 "More Answers" buttons?).	69				0
favorites and not so favorited vs data are heuristic violations rename the columns or just dont name them at all likes vs dislikes suffices i dont think you need to make functionality for removing categories i like the ones you had with basic info about the person and likesdislikes emotion tracker doesnt make much sense overall i think a lot of functionality is missing also its riddled with heuristic violations	70				0
for example by observing someone who uses itunes netflix hulu youtube etc altogether for watching movies or video clips maybe you would learn that the primary complaint users have is that it isnt easy to retrieve the information about something she watched most recently if so how can we streamline that specific use scenario maybe designing a search functionality to easily obtain a specific piece of information could be useful	70				0
its interesting to look at the mechanical aspects of editingupdating individual resumes but at the same time i wish i could see different aspects of it mainly about the interaction around having a resume discussing the resumes among friends or other colleagues if any and how those resumes are handed off to recruiters also investigating different styles of resumes in found in other disciplines could make the topic more inclusive	70				0
the instructions dont give the user a specific task to complete this task should test out the core functionality in a way that gives them a real scenario that they might use the wishlist which you mentioned was a key part of the motivational component of your app seems to be a secondary feature there isnt any focus on goalbased savings which is what you originally pitched your app as	70				0
The visual design is both simple and complicated simultaneously. I think there's something good here in that the user doesn't have to click through several layers before reaching the right controls but at the same time it is hard to scan through the app's UI. There's probably a way to strike a balance here (maybe the UI for a certain set of controls gets bigger when you look at it?)	70				0
As we tlaked about in class, I think a skii mask band would be a better alternative as it would really help the headset stay on the users head especially with a heavy phone in place. Since your lead user expressed issue with having to hold up the headset, I don't think your solution as it stands now will solve that problem. My solution is the skii band for more durability.	71				0
For the foot design, it seems like you don't really make much use of that left column for My Reservations, and it might be better to eliminate it (Once you reserve a time slot, it might be better to text your phone the reminders/send it to your watch) Also, try to show what happens after you reserve a time slot (maybe indicate your times with a different color on the tablet?)	71				0
i like the idea of using an hp bar as an analogy for money depletion i think it can give the user a more holistic view of their budget rather than focusing on exact monetary amounts the next steps would be to think about how can you reward users for staying under budget or saving enough for some goal how can you potentially factor in regular expenses ie rent bills etc	71				0
the home screen is not too clear exactly what the app does some basic labels as to what the eggs are might be useful also the information that i input for each dream drawing doesnt appear anywhere it might be useful to also state why those practices are useful or bring them more to the forefront of the app because right now they kinda seem random right after the drawing activity	71		1	0	1
I like the simplicity of the watch face. But it would be better there is something to click on after it shows "Too Dry" and pH level. It's awkard the flow just stops there. The design for foot and yard is a little bit too chaotic. Yard: Staring at the mirror and reading so many words is very weird. It would be better to have pictures instead of words. Maybe some animations.	72				0
I like this because I'm a gamer myself that has poor time management when it comes to games. It would be cool if the app can immediately turn off the game (after they let the user save the game of course) and lock them out so they're not tempted to go back and play. Or have them solve a puzzle before letting them into the game if they REALLY want to continue.	72				0
Not sure how big the product is, but for the lighting setup display, the box might be a bit small to represent the lights if there are a lot of them and would give a hard time to people with larger fingers to accurataley press what they want. Same with the drag & drop sections or the 'Save to Score' and 'Add to Cue' buttons whether they're touch screen or actual buttons.	72				0
the feature youre ab testing is fine but were not so certain how your team would measure pacing i would instead suggest encourage you to track where the user clicks when viewing the project that is put a tracker in both the title and title and image for your a and b respectively and determine if the the user was more inclined to click on the article if the image is present	72	1	0	1	2
the kind of information the app provides is interesting it covers different body parts and their progresses separately however you might want to be careful whether thats what the user really wants similarly about having users input all the reps they have done if the most interesting piece of information users focus on is hypothetically the part they skipped or slacked off on why bother having them go through that tedious process	72				0
Your functionality does a really good job at keeping the target user awake and no longer sleeping by distracting him. One thing I'd consider is what is the end goal? Is it to just ensure they're awake, or is it to get them out of bed and into getting ready? If you're trying to get them to eat breakfast, the activities should slowly lead towards that, but it depends on your user.	72				0
Definitely love how futuristic this interface is heading. Right now, im currently using Amazon Alexa crossed with a bunch of TPLINK wireless plug. They allow me to control my lights, my tv, my fridge by using voice commands or interface. Its very similar to your design. I recommend you to check it out :). However, definitely love this idea that we can control different things by just one simple interface. Great Job :D	73				0
For the yard, maybe you could display not only Thomas's but also everyone's statuses as well. It can be like those old AIM statuses or even like how Slack does it. This way other people will know who is available to hang out and who is not. This also works in Thomas's favor because maybe one day he wants to hang out with his apartmentmates but his apartmentmates have a midterm that week.	73				0
I dont see how selecting the area and type of massage is helpful using this interface. Does it provide you with instructions on how to do the massage or just narrow down the movements into types of massage positions one can do for that region. It would be nice if it provided video instruction on how to do the motion and more information on the massage, like in your inch and yard interfaces.	73				0
I like that there are checkboxes next to the items to check off, but it would be even more helpful to have a separate shopping list since some items repeat themselves (and have it labeled in the shopping list as to which meals a certain amount of the ingredients go with). It would also be helpful to include recipes. There's a lot of white space that can be utilized in the food module.	73				0
I really like the creative idea of using a controller for the large display, try to consider other options for the other UIs, such as perhaps Augmented Reality with the tablet (holding it up will "load" the region through the eyes of the camera), or maybe the watch can "change the environment" for the tablet/display. Not too sure what else I'd recommend for the watch, but nevertheless this is a really cool idea!	73				0
Inch interface is too much for an iWatch interface. If the inch interface is used for dirsections a map will not be the best way to show this because of how small it will be. Similarly, if you have the ability to search for furniture at the other sizes, it seems like the current design for purchases furniture at the inch display will just be too complicated for the space you have available.	73				0
It's a good idea to create a plant pot online market. Some of the users may regard plant pots as a kind of art collection. On the other hand, probably most of the users need plant pots because they have plants and want to put them in pots. Therefore, the plant might become one of the most important issue in the market. It is better to have section that is relative to plants.	73				0
Nice to see it fleshed out. Main questions is, if the current user task is to search, then should the screen be refocused on the results and information of the search? I feel like if the answer is yes and it is done on the map, then maybe there might be more information possible on the map. It seemed to me the focus was on the search information, on the right sidebar, though	73				0
some functionality issues some of the icons dont link anywhere ie the history or notification icons when i login and go to the missions page i get an internal server error when i try to add a location and click the add photo icon it takes me out back to the map without allowing me to continue adding my location is there some sort of confirmation that my location has been added successfully	73	1	0	1	2
two notes i would like to mention 1 not all users can be motivated by a mere notification perhaps add some incentive for the users research what motivates your users rewards punishments 2 what is the purpose of the messaging system is it just to talk to your housemates maybe the chat system could be replaced with a push notification ie if your housemate forgot to take out a trash click remind housemates	73				0
For the foot size design for pad interface, it would be good to combine your functionality of choosing different media (originally on your yard display) and your functionality of showing comments into the Foot Interface. So that you can choose the articles you want to watch, get the recommended articles based on your reading habits, and review the history of the articles you read and share the article to someone who matters to you.	74				0
Great idea! I think an app that could do this definitely would be very useful, as the current Alarm app is quite manual. One interface to consider using would be a watch, as the functionality can be quick and simple (and doesn't require a big UI to function properly), and you could also make the user take 100+ steps until the watch has deemed they've taken enough of a break until it stops again	74				0
Foot: I like the ranking system and the todo list but I don't think there needs to be a list of relaxing activities to do unless those are specific activities the user plans to do that day. Instead it would be nice if the relaxling list was replaced with todos that don't need to be done that day but can be in free time such as making a car appointment, going for a run, etc.	75				0
I super like the idea of putting sensors on the foot. It is just great! But I just feel like lt is a really rare case that people are forced to put up their hands and they have to send the signal through their foots. And I feel like if they are already in such a situation, it is already too late for them to send the signal since their life is already in danger.	75				0
although aiming for creating such a habitforming service wasnt particularly the goal for this assignment but because there is a chance that the irregular or rare usage of it could potential harm the usability of the app i urge you to think about how to leverage on or incorporate the social or contextual information into your idea such that you have a compelling answer to the question why should i use health togo instead of xxx	76				0
For most of the case, when you leave home, you probabaly want to turn off all the light to reduce energy usage. Therefore, it is better to have a button that can turn off all the light to reduce effort to turn off lights manually. If the button is the one under the schedule, it's better to put it on top of all the button since it is the most important and effecient position for control.	76				0
I wish you could have a clear way to indicate how users choose the objects they want to see. Because there may be tons of objects, things, people, and etc. appear at the same time in front of users' eyes, it's hard for the technology to determine which one the users would like to know. Maybe you could create a button to calibrate the scale and chooce the certain object the users want to look at.	76				0
One of the things that OneNote does that I really like is that once you have highlighted something in that color or used that text color, that color is automatically saved so you only have to hit the button once instead of clicking in and selecting the color. Another suggestion I have is to incorporate shortcuts that would make notetaking faster. For example, if the user types (!), the app would automatically highlight that bullet point.	76				0
you submitted to citizen science but thats ok make sure its correct next time pretty good start try to collect other facets of information thats about all the data you need for finances unless you really motivate a potential correlation of a piece of financial information with another facets information also the budget is secondary to the main function of the app which is to show relationships between finances and other facets of a persons life	76				0
I do believe being able to see and explore other peoples opinions through comments, tags, etc. is a great way to get a new perspective on the article. Something about seeing a ton of comments and people discussing the topic is exciting and adds a sense of humanity to the article. I know in my experience, I love being able to see what other people think because it helps me form my own opinions about the article.	77				0
I like that the user can check if she's getting into the right car or not, but I'm not sure that having to tap her phone against the driver's phone is the best solution. Many drivers have their phones on a car mount which is sometimes hard to take on and off frequently. It might be better to just confirm the driver based on location and how far their phone is from the user's phone or something.	77				0
I not really a big fan of spending hours inputting my schedule, and make changes to it whenever I have a schedule change. Would it be possible for me to just import my schedule decently from google calendar, facebook events calendar, webreg2, and iphone calendar, and smartly combine them together. And give user options to slightly customize some events if they want. But I do think the process of creating the schedule should be simpler and eaiser.	77				0
I think instead of an alarm, which can send Justin into an unncessary panic mode, the music should just automatically pause. The lack of music would be more than enough of an indicatator to Justin. Another thing is that if you're already afraid of wakling home alone at night, you really don't want the app to be alerting you every time a jogger runs past you. You only really want to be alert to actual potential dangers.	77				0
I feel like you are in a big rush when doing this assignment, as the interface across three scales are too primitive for me to get the idea of what you actually want to put on those pixels. For example, therer are a great amount of white spaces on the foot size interface. It looks like there is aa comment section in it but other than that, I don't know what the foot size interface is used for	78				0
I really like all the content your app provides! One thing I'd suggest is perhaps adding the ability for the user to customize or rearrange some of the functionalities (Youtube, Reddit, Daily News) on the tablet/yard displays, or at least have them automatically adjust based on what the user is currently doing. The breakfast section also seems a bit crammed for the tablet, and it doesn't really seem like a UI with a lot of interaction right now	78				0
I really like the ability to see different furniture configurations in a simulation of your house, however, I dont see an easy way to add additional pieces of furniture. I may have missed something but that seems like a really necessary ability. Furthermore, say I don't know that the furniture store has this capability and I come in without a picture of my house, having the ability to costruct furniture configurations in a generic room would be useful.	78				0
I think instead of each person donating 3 pumpkins, Tommy should be able to request an X amount of pumpkins (depending on the number of students) and then people will donate if they want too. It will be kind of like a kickstarter for pumpkin donating. The other thing is that maybe if one class has a surplus of supplies, the app could suggest that the donor donate to another class that may not have as much supplies.	78				0
travel log has no popup info for the event the map doesnt work and is confusing its really secondary functionality dont make it the home page anymore just have a map tab and instead a simple table of events is useful enough like the travel log the summary page should then clearly connect with the travel log maybe the map can be one of the summaries i want to see more data collected and visualized about the adventures	78				0
There is a problem for idea 1 interface. If the user' requirements are quick specific and lots of students took lots of time and efforts to make the pots but user only choose one to buy, how about other works that have been created? If there is no better solutions to deal with their works, most of the students will be disappointed and no longer want to work anymore. This market may collapse in a certain amount of time.	79				0
After clicking on "Call Emergency Contacts," I wouldn't really understand what the red and green circles mean as someone using it for the first time, especially for those who are red/green colorblind. Perhaps you can change the text that says "Call Emergency Contacts" to something more descriptive since it doesn't really make sense to keep it as "Call Emergency Contacts" after you've already pressed it. Perhaps "Calling Emergency Contacts" and "Emergency Contact Has Answer" or something would be more helpful.	80				0
I wish you could organize the Course Pool by quarter offer. It seesm that currently the order is random. When students are thinking about their four year plan, they care a lot about which quarter the course offer. Therefore, I wish you could have better way to organize the courses to make this section more intuitive. Maybe you could try using categorized section. You can see how cognitive science department organize courses of one year plan in their official website.	80				0
it will be confounded with the people who would click on the link anyway because there isnt much to click on in our apps anyway i suspect the effect of your change wont be significant thats ok but if you have another idea that you could make a conditional condition for like measuring the number of users who go to the emotions page after entering in an event making changes around that might help with the cohesion of your app	80	1	1	1	3
two suggestions 1 there were a couple of points in your observation report that discussed about the collaborative aspect of the end result of cooking eg inviting friends over what about collaboration in cooking itself this might actually be an interesting design opportunity as cooking as a household is different from cooking and preparing meals as an individual for thyself for example its just an idea and also perfectly fine if you want to focus on the current target audience	80				0
Why not just provide a button like "Use the nearest bus stop" to find the route? It takes too much time for a voice to activate this functionality. Also, when showing the commuting time, the number of bus should also be shown or users don't know which bus is gonna arrive first. I would prefer to see all the available buses in the next 10 mins on a single interface rather than two seperate ones, which requires me to swipe.	80				0
From my understanding of the diagrams, it seems that there are 3 main interfaces - auto scan, main interface, and manual adjustment. Why not remove the "swipe left" and "swipe right" interfaces? Why does the user have to do any of this herself? The app should automatically scan the environment and play the most optimal audio track without input from the user. How is she going to focus on her studies if she has to spend time fine-tuning her noise cancellation?	81				0
The lead user scenario seems unlikely as well - why whould Corrin go to Starbucks to study as a second choice when there are a plethora of other quiet areas to go study at - equidistant from Geisel to Starbucks (fireside lounge, the zone, commuter lounge, PC PCLab, CogSci lab, etc). Starbucks is also not a quiet place - while she doesn't necessarily have a "choice" in that noise-cancelling headphones give her headaches, she certainly has the choice to study elsewhere.	81				0
The wall view is nice because it has the dog and probably other encouragement animals. It might be here where the list view is good. I'm a little taken aback by the whole display of the task. Is this displaying something you type in? Seems like a lot of work just for inputing one task, especially since the assignment itself has already been written up. Might be better if it opened a web browser that opened a link to the content.	81				0
good job like i said in studio the main challenge here might be the amount of initial work users have to put in order to get up to the speed and be able to use the app how can we further streamline the process of inputting the data of your closet if one owns a ton of clothes for example it would be really hard to convince users to take pictures of every single item in the closet in the first place	82				0
In general, I like the idea of information at a glance. Like Scott said in class, it'd be good if the information was user-centered e.g. might want to bring an umbrella because it is drizzling. For the general all-in-one view, maybe the controls could be less functional since it would be slightly harder to calibrate the exact lighting I want. I might hit another scale or button by mistake. On the other hand, the control is good for specific view and preferences.	82				0
Great work overall! But just a quick question: How would this interface work for more hidden places? I know that the Empire State Building is pretty noticable, but what if the landmark was a statue that wasn't viewable from the user's current position? Could the app give them hints as to where it might be? Could the user use the foot interface to be shown different images of the street she's in that shows where the landmark is relative to her current location?	83				0
I really like your idea that makes use of the Hololens. Hololens is a very hot topic around the world currently. You idea is very unique in this class. In addition to use the Hololens to present your project, I believe you can extend you idea a bit in the future. Hololens is a powerful tool but just few people are using it. Therefore, I wish you could come up some great idea that broaden the usage of hololens in people's daily life.	83				0
nice name for the app it has a nice ring to it the app functionality and features appear to be good and well thought out however how might your team differentiate this app from preexisting group tasks todo apps i would recommend looking into the various features of popular apps so that your team could nuance your app from them moreover you can also look at your audience community for inspiration on the special niches that would only be available in cliq it	83				0
I find the list view kind of scary. I like being able to put whatever comes to mind into an app, but seeing the list is utterly frightening, which is why I don't like to do lists like Wunderlist. Google Calendar is nice because it spreads rthings out, orders them, etc. The best one is probably Android's built in notification system where Google itself will pop a notification of a reminder. I think the task list itself should be abstracted out by the app	84				0
I think for a lot of people, safety would be the biggest concern when walking back to their apartment late at night. I imagine people who are distracted by their phones are easier targets for robbers/molestors. If your user is on the bus or another form of public transportation, this would be more useful. Another comment that I have is that the current idea you have for your app is basically your phone. What can your app offer that the user's phone doesn't have?	84				0
Interacting with the 70 inch display seems like a lot of fun when ordering (if the order isn't too large). It could be cool to include a lot of preset meals which would make it overall easier to order something quickly, which is important for such a large scale in my opinion (people can't wait around). Also, seems like the persona for task 3 should be someone adding their order to a queue and getting in line, instead of someone ordering for hours later.	84				0
This is really a good idea. The only problem for this product is the development of technology. However, even though current technology has not been able to support your product, I believe the revolution will go fast in next decade and our life may be totally different. It's great to have perspective of future product. I hope you can add more details to your inferefaces and provide a hint for current technology to improve the way you would like to be in your project.	84				0
Inch: I like the convenience that the inch interface provides. For some of the screens though, the buttons are a bit too close together for an inch interface and could be difficult to tap on such a small screen, leading to accidentally pressing something the user didn't mean to press. You might consider using other gestures or different types of input than tapping for selection. Also, the red font on the gray breakground is difficult to read. Perhaps choosing a different color would work better.	85				0
really good start but you can simplify a few things dont focus on the discussion board at all have a very minimal feature for the reminders just a date and tag maybe you can display on the home page if its near but thats stretch goal the suggestions for conversation topics is not sufficient for the brief can you make them dynamic and reflective of the relationship itself expand more on the first 15 seconds of the video what data are you collecting what graphs	85				0
For the inch design, I would like a way to see events that are happening later on during the week. From what I can see here, the user can only see events that are happening immediately at that time. For the foot design, instead of clicking on the banner to add it to the schedule, I would like to simply hold and drag it over. I would like to click on it to expand the information or other options regarding the event, such as "Who's going?".	86				0
I like how your friend is starting from a completely blank slate and envisioning a brand new way to organize their life. They identitifed a problem with currently existing journals and modified his to fit his individual needs. I like how simple the design is. It uses bullets and tabs in order to organize the content to a way that aids his eyes to read the written information. The use of white space is also very well tought out. The symbolism is simple but highly effective.	86				0
I like the idea of the voice recognition as a way to launch or hide UI. However, when people are visiting the museum, I think voice control might not be useful since museum or photo exhibition in most cases should be a quiet place. So it might be a good idea to introduce geasture control as an alternative to the voice control. A good example would be Hololens' tap gesture to select while user is gazing. Otherwise you could introduce new type of gesture as well.	86				0
good ideas on making the app of a competitive nature but think carefully about how to make this different from strava nike or other such running apps one thing that could help in this is thinking about the main purpose of your app is it to help prepare for competitive running races or to help people who dont normally run these two povs are fundamentally different and by better tailoring app to one of these or something else could be useful in helping you find a direction	87				0
The lower part of the foot design are so clustered and crowded and I feel like it is easy for user to miss click on something. For example, the foot design is not that large, so the relatively small dail on the lower half of the design seems like hard to perform a turning gesture. Also, I believe when you are turning a dial on the lower half, it is easy to touch the slide bar and move the slide bar when you are not intended to.	87				0
the month visualization of the mood diary could be better i like the emoji representation for each day but maybe you can update what is displayed for the different categories of data you collect instead of emotions have a little picture of the balance pie chart make it so that the user can select different summary statistics to display over each day analytics page is kind of clunky good job with calendar you dont need to put more work into it its pretty clear what its for	87				0
This is an awesome idea! I never would have thought of doing something like this. I am not sure how easy it will be to use for a redesign but the simplest thing would be to try and create a plastic version or something with an elastic top so it can fit around different types of sink heads. One idea would be a website for hacking simlpe household problems with cheap items that you likely already have in your house where people can post ideas like this.	87				0
For tablet is the user supposed to be standing up? It's a bit unclear about that (do they stand and hold it?), or is it intended for when theyre sitting down? If so, the user should be reflecting that. Also, why do you number the slider 1, 2, 3, 4? It's a bit unclear why each position is arbitrarily set to a number, especially when a vertical slider might be better to match the body height (and the relative position correlates to which body part posture needs work)	88				0
Going off from the comment above, you should also think of how to make use of the surronding space around the user since the user can freely move their heads and enjoy the immersive experience. For example, would it be a good idea to take people back to the scene where this photo was taken (which can be a 360 degree video)? Would it be a good idea to pops out the 3D model of the building showed up in the photo if it is an important information?	88				0
great job on this weeks assignment the development plan is easy to read and eyecatching to better the development plan include the deadline dates and reword the tasks to be more specific and actionable instead of implement unique interactions unique interactions with users and features write display user information such as name birth date and email on their profile page for example if that was your unique interaction for the next update make sure to include these changes also lol at the 1000 hours for creating an app name	89				0
great start talk to some ecologists that might find this app useful see what other data you might collect also make a map screen where the users can see where previously identified plants are wizard of oz the data and the gps location data collection this makes the space around the user educational and if they find something new they can turn it over to the community to help identify it also create a reward structure to motivate the users to identify plants this has pokemon go level potential	89				0
I like the idea and task behind this design. I wish there was another way of inputting car and problem information since it may be hard to identify (especially for people who are less experienced than your lead user). It would be cool if you could take photos/videos/audio of your car and the specific problem then upload it to the system which will identify the problem, put it in text form so you know what's going on, and search for a solution for you based on what you uploaded.	89				0
Yard: I like that the waiting numbers and estimated wait times are easily visible. I wish you could see the prices for featured items though. I also wish that estimated wait times for specific numbers were visible since the current estimate wait times seem like they only show the wait times for the next available seat at the table/bar. For the numbers indicating if a table is waiting/ready (yellow/green), consider using a different way to distinguish between the two since there are a number of people who are colorblind.	89				0
Inch: I like that the user will be warned when she is about to do something she shouldn't, like eating seafood, and that she can use vocal input to set alarms (at least that's what I think the screens are showing). However, sometimes, new mothers are not completely about what they should be doing. Not sure if this is something already considered in the interface, but it would be cool to have pre-inputted personalized notifications based on how far along she is in the pregnancy and her current body conditions.	90				0
One important thing to note that is you mentioned the task is to book a hostel close to places/public transportation, but the map currently doesn't indicate any public transportation areas, and it would also be nice to select multiple hostels to compare/contrast their proximity to specific attractions (if my goal is to go to Van Gogh, I need to consider the hostels near there, because for most people they plan their trips around the attractions/destinations they want to visit, then focus on the other not-so-important attractions/destinations that are nearby afterwards)	90				0
For the widgets, you do a good job with your current explanations, but see if there's a way to convey the same meanings in less words (so it's easier to read especially on such a small screen). One example of this would be just flashing 'DONE' or using a green color to symbolize its done In addition, if there's multiple dryers available, it shouldn't matter (just let them request a dryer and assign them one, especially if they're all on the same floor) - minimize the user's need for decision making	91				0
great job on this weeks assignment the development plan is well thought out and easy to read two things i would like to add is to 1 update it so that it is more consistent 030 vs 05 hours and 2 reword your tasks to be more actionable and specific instead of create 2 lowfi prototypes 1 home page 2 any other page split the task up to be more specific such as display a list of projects on the home page for next week make sure to add these changes	91				0
I really like the idea of activity to take a break during a period of work, especially when programming. My one issue is location since I personally would not feel comfortable dancing in front of other people. There should be different activities for different locations such as stretching or going for a walk if you are not at home. Another issue is the frownie face when preforming a dance. I like the idea but I am a terrible dancer and it would aggravate me if I kept failing the dance moves	91				0
I really liked how non-intrusive your visual design is. The stats and other feedback all live on the very bottom of the screen and do not get in the way of what I am trying to code. I also like how consistent your commands are with currently existing commands. The use of colons and short words as commands make the interaction very familiar and comfortable. The learn mode is also very visually comfortable. The large screen in the middle is very apporopriate since it must grab the attention of the user.	91				0
and the followings are the two needs presented that include the term bank 1 students need a way to better understand their bank account data since the students need to know where exactly he went and on what he spent the money the current bank account software provides confusing descriptions of each transaction 2 students need a way to better organize their cards and bank accounts since different cards need to be used on and off campus on different occasions specifically for commuters multiple cards make it more difficult to keep track of	93				0
For the pantry, I would argue to put the date you bought the item as opposed to estimating when it expires. If you do decide to go with this idea, I would suggest for you to keep it consistent and also apply the same item to the items that was purchased from the store. I would also encourage allowing the user to take a photo as it allows for the user to scan through the interface quickly. It would also let older users (such as grandma and grandpa) use the app more easily.	93				0
I really liked the overall implementation of this video, and how it's suited to helping people not familiar with the recipe and guiding them through the process step by step. One thing that would be interesting to see is how harder techniques (folding, minicing, etc. would be shown), as well as when one needs to multitask (boil water, stir the soup, while mixing ingredients, etc.) as I could imagine the audio assistant going all over the place when the user has to do multiple things at once, which could overwhelm/stress the user out	93				0
the observations can go more in detail about the breakdowns and successes the subjects encountered for example in johns case what actions did he make that proved to you that he had a hard time keeping track of his diet did he forget to write down his meals and calorie intake or does he try to memorize the number of calories he ate but fails to remember exactly in nikkos case how successful is he with his myfitnessplan why does he lose motivation even though he makes an active effort to use it	93				0
2 points of extra credit awarded because of the great visual design super cute animated corgi and functionality good work some things i would be aware of the input expenses page upon creating an account is a bit confusing because theres no confirm option after each item is entered it might be more useful to leave that off until the user enters the main page of the app also its not super clear that clicking the pet will take the user to the store so you might want a direct link to the store as well	96				0
I am still a bit confused about what is being accomplished at the yard scale -- am I interacting with the surface or is it simply displaying what I have already ordered? I think having it display in a simple manner what me or my party has ordered would be a nice reminder and a good way to keep the overall order organized (especially for larger parties). People could then have the option to make changes based off of what the yard scale is showing them (e.g. if there are errors or discrepancies in the order).	96				0
The tablet displays a lot of information which is fine, but where there are so many options I get the Facebook Messenger feeling of I just want to open a message and I have to deal with stories, camera, who's online. I think the first step is to make a way for me to know where the controls are in a consistent way, whereas here I see I can use the camera at pixel location (80% X-Axis, 75% Y-Axis) which seems random. as a microexample, the clock interface has a column of toggles. That's good consistency	96				0
Foot: I wish that the relevant information (estimated wait time) is more noticeable. Perhaps you could dedicate more pixels to that rather than something else like the number of people slider. Curious as to the color choice between the "Bar" and "Table" button colors as well as the green "Create Ticket" and red "Create Ticket" on the next screen. For selecting a specific quantity, a slider makes it difficult to do that since it's hard to precisely make the circle stop where you want. A slider also limits the quantity of people (what about bigger 20+ groups?).	97				0
For the yard scale, do not forget that the mirrow has a purpose besides interacting with the application... looking at yourself! currently, The interface gets in the way of the mirrors main use. Maybe you could leave the whole middle empty, and using voice commands bring different windows into view to check out their content. Additionally, a yard interface on a mirro may have buttons tat you can't reach as well as not wanting to get ifngerprints all over the mirror, so if I were you I would center the interaction around voice as much as possible.	97	1	1	1	3
I like the idea of easily finding friends in a class but I feel like the majority of your designs can be done with simple texts. I think it would be more interesting if you focused more on finding friends on campus such as when you only have an hour break or something. This way instead of having to text everyone individually and see if they are on campus you can just look at your phone and see where everyone is. Maybe there could also be a way to set a status such as "free", "homework" etc.	97	1	1	1	3
We spoke about this in class but I think there needs to be a way to put the main table at an angle that is more comfortable for drawing. I also feel like there are too many moving parts at the moment. Maybe stick to one big screen that can moved to different angles and then one ipad like screen that can sync up. One idea (not reallly possible in the real world) is to create something similar to the drawing board in Black Mirror. Here is a link to the specific part of the episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yUPyjdVyds&start=415	97	1	1	1	3
i agree with your points and the design changes but having multiple changes in one screen buttons design notification feature removal of the image album and the map etc will make it harder for you to reason about what might have led to users potentially different behavior i recommend either separating out those changes to different urls thus isolating them and controlling for the variance or aligning the original version with the new one by applying some of other changes the new one has the latter might be simpler in any ways dont remove the changes you made	98	1	1	1	3
I wonder for your first case of a breaklight couldn't the user just type it into youtube for a tutorial? I like the idea of this interface but you need to make it very clear why this is better than just using youtube. Most cases can be figured out through a simple google search or youtube tutorial. I am a bit confused as to where the ticket goes? I understand that you are saying youtube is not a good source but can you give an example where it isnt? or a simple call to a dealership won't work?	98	1	1	1	3
the interaction flow is confusing for first time users searching for a movie looking at the detail clicking add coming back to the home page could be one natural flow of using the app but a there is no state update upon clicking add which is confusing for the users and b once the user gets confused she will go check other pages to see if there was a change but seems like there isnt any or maybe i just couldnt find it which implies that the flow is a little confusing check out the video below httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnn2rlpoclcq	98	1	1	1	3
taking pictures of trash this actually isnt too far from the brief its just that youre treating the users as subjects but dont have much justification for doing so like if this were a really well motivated and hard to answer question which it might be but you need to convince me then having an app that people sort their trash with and data on that sorting are useful then its fine if you stick with this idea think more about your data and data visualizations what graphs would you want to show the scientist interested in these data	99	1	1	1	3
its great that you included a testimonial of the usability of the app interviewing diverse stakeholders including a healthcare professional like in this case is critical to understanding the deeper implication of the app and therefore however this testimonial largely consists of speculation although it provides a special scenario where healthetree can be useful its only logical to think that this scenario was and should have been considered from the design phase of the app without much evidence found from realworld use case however i want to commend your effort and its a great start toward a more qualitative assessment	100	1	1	1	3
For the Inch size design, I assume it is designed for apple watch. I think it is a great idea to preserve your functionality of vibrating when certain breaking news is pushed to your device. However, instead of making it an interface to read the actual article, I would make apple watch more like a reminder to remind you that there is an such news going on (or maybe shows a really brief introduction or title of the article), so that you will know you can pull out your phone or ipad to read those articles when you are on the bus.	102	1	1	1	3
I like the idea of having fallback mechanisms for when users potentially fall back asleep after snoozing the first alarm. This is definitely an issue that I face. I do think the puzzle might be hard first thing in the morning, especially if it is randomly generated each day (could generate a potentially harder puzzle). I know this is for a specific user so this might be find for him. Something else that would keep me up is solving a different puzzle, such as one that requires you to slide your finger across a maze or something that isn't so mentally taxing.	102	1	1	1	3
good start i saw that you have a weekly calendar with kindness for each day how informative is that graph really are there more important questions to be asking about kindness and my mood ask more from the user about how they feel what their motivation was for doing it what kind of act of kindness was it expand more on the data and the visualizations focus less on less informative visualizationsfeatures i really liked the minimal input screen with the smileys and the short response box try to cram more information into that input screen without losing the feel it has now	103	1	1	1	3
Great idea overall! One thing I think that would be helpful is to explain what types of commands would be provided (what makes it chosen specifically for them? Do they do a lot of selecting and copying? Do they format their code a lot?) In addition, the statistics is nice, but it depends what the user's overall goal is - is it to increase their overall time efficiency, or is it to learn Vim commands?) I guess it's fine to keep it since otherwise this Vim add on is really simple, but just keep in mind what the user's long term goal is.	103	1	1	1	3
I like the layout and see it as a strong improvement over the wacom tablet and accurately solves the problem you have. One modification I would appreciate is the ability to have the tablet separate from the monitors so that the monitors can be put on a stand and easily viewable. Screen glare is a strong issue for completely parallel monitors, so putting them on some sort of stand (not as vertical as a computer monitor, yet not completely parallel __maybe at a 20-40_ angle) would solve this issue and only necessitate the user to move their eyes instead of craning their neck	103	1	1	1	3
This is extemerly specifc. Well Done ! I'm looking at the interface and i'm able to understand the function of this product. The wordings are clear and I like the picture and the slider bar that represent the work out you are doing and how its affecting you. I can see myself using this a lot when im on a workout plan or just working out for fun. For the watch interface, it will be cooler if theres some motivation sense behind it. Therefore, not only i can use this interface to check my growth, it will motivate me to do better !	103	1	1	1	3
Your watch design is good but keep in mind the actual iWatch is very small, and its highly unlikely you can click the icons / even view them without some squinting so you may want to try a different UI or larger buttons, because the image depicting Khirbat en-Nahas, Jordon isn't going to be feasible when ported to the iWatch. Similarly, clicking on the tiny location markers in the globe isn't going to be feasible, and I'd suggest making use of a swiping UI (swipe left/right to change places within a countries?, swipe up/down to change continents), or Audio to specify a place	103	1	1	1	3
I like the similicity of the design but I am confused by the top results because they seem to go against your reasoning that google search and youtube do not work. My suggestion would be a way on connecting this to car forums such as ones on reddit because while this app could be helpful, at the moment it seems similar to a google search especially with the button for "Can't find issue? Create a new one" at this point I would call an auto shop. I strongly suggets thinking about what makes this app different and why you believe people should use it?	104	1	1	1	3
your app is very impressive the interactions are really cool however there are a few bugs so make sure to fix them before user testing some other things to improve upon new chat messages should be appended at the end instead of the top and sign up page should have a back button to the loginsignup page just in case they mess up on their email or password or if the email is already in use i noticed there are a lot of notification messages so i like how you guys kept the nielsens heuristics in mind keep it up and overall great job	104	1	1	1	3
Foot: I really like the "See what your neighbors are cooking" idea especially if there is a way to join in and cook together. I am still unsure of the purpose for tracking water. Maybe track drinks in general for the purpose of tracking soda, beer, etc. For the exercise aspect I would do something similar to "see what your neighbors are cooking" and make a version for exercise. I would also suggest a way to look up exercises based off of what you have been doing recently (and logged) instead of just searching because that can be difficult, especially when you have little experience.	105	1	1	1	3
The functionality is really impressive. VIM is already a very powerful tool, and your upgrade makes it even better to use. I too often have the problem of not nowing specific commands and not knowing if they even exist. By reminding users of commands they have not used, and even providing recommendations and statistics, I would be much more inclined to user VIM as a new user. It would not seem as threating and I would feel like VIM cares about my learning. The learn mode makes a lot of sense and I would like to see more of your UI for this particular feature.	105	1	1	1	3
very attractive idea i think there are enough design opportunities for you to design something that users can find a lot of value with since we wear most of the clothes for more than once if not many more times if you can convince users to provide the initial work to take a picture of each of the clothing items that they have for example but you might want to be careful in this approach since there can be gazillions of items that each person owns they might be able to breeze through the steps that come after and actually start loving using your app	105	1	1	1	3
What if there are too many people at the demo session? It would be too crowded for all spectators to point their camera at what the Hololens user is seeing. For interface 1, along with having a camera view, I think it would be useful to allow the user to choose between camera view and 1st person(what the Hololens user is seeing). This way, users that are close enough to the Hololens user can use their camera to see what the Hololens user is seeing, and users that are too far can use the 1st person view to see exactly what the Hololens user is seeing.	106	1	1	1	3
Yard: I am unsure of whether the complete button is pressed when the assignment is complete or that means it is already complete. I do like that the assignment with top priority has a larger space on the screen. I am not sure what the line graph represents so that should be made more apparent. Since this is a large screen the music bar should be smaller. Along the same lines I am not sure why the dog is so big if he is simply for voice commands. I would suggest just having the user talk into their watch instead to interact with the yard scale.	106	1	1	1	3
I get that the lead user is probably a teacher who is looking for ways to supply his Halloween activities, but the lead user is ALSO the people/schools who actually signaled a desire to donate. My question is whether this is accurate, because on one hand, if so then it sounds like there is something to examine with donator-side UI. If not, then my question is who will populate the data on who the donators are. I also feel that asking someone to donate to your cause is a large enough request, but having them learn a new UI is an added layer of complexity within the request	108	1	1	1	3
I think the information you are providing is extremely useful to the users. Would there be a way to input what the user wants to work on for the inch and yard designs? It seems that they are mostly for viewing and keeping track of information, but not really for inputting any goals. The foot desing does have the checkboxes for inputing data though, so that is very helpful. I would like it for the yard desing, there was informaion regarding how long to rest for and how much water I should drink and maybe recommend how much protein or creatine I should take. Great job so far!	108	1	1	1	3
Inch: I like the idea of finding where someone is in a classroom but the problem is that if the person did not save the user a seat then there is no point in this. Also I feel like just texting the person would work as well. It is helpful to know who is in your class to grab notes afterwards so maybe the inch interaction could just be seeing who out of your friends is in the class and whether they took notes? (Also could be done with a text but sometimes you won't know your friends are in the class because they can be so large)	108	1	1	1	3
again because your app is just made really small it appears to be tiny on a mobile setting which is where your app would be the most applicable your users might not be able to use your app properly unless it is responsive to different browser sizes you can do this by making your sizes relative rather than absolute currently you have your app measured in terms of pixels px you can make it responsive by measuring your app in terms of a percent for example if you make your app width 50 your app will fit 50 of the screen regardless of screen size making your app much more userfriendly	111	1	1	1	3
3) I think it would be really useful if, on the 6th screen of the inch scale, displayed the amount of time it would take for the user to get to the restaurant from his/her location. I also think it would be helpful for the user if the text on top was more specific. Like, if it said "Your table will be ready in 5 minutes." Not everyone will interpret, "Your table is almost ready!" the same way. For example, one user might interpret that "almost ready" means he has 1 minute until his table is ready, while another user might think that he/she has 5 minutes until the table is ready.	112	1	1	1	3
For the inch design, I like how large the buttons are since they allow me to see the text better. I would add in a menu that allowed me to see my saved events and what events are happening in the future. For the foot design, I would like a way to delete some events from my schedule if I am not longer interested. It would also be really cool if I could add it to my Google Calendar somehow. For the yard design, I love the large graphics and how intuitive the options are. The random button is also a great idea, since sometimes people don't know how to make decisions.	112	1	1	1	3
I'm so confused by the UI because it essentially looks like a written list of supplies and a grid of possible donators. I did not see how the UI helps the user get into contact with the donators. In general, the amount of text in the video prevented me from examining the UI in a progressive video playback. It may have done better as text outside/above the video. I would love to see the interaction between the lead user and the app, but I saw something that looked less like an app and more like a literal pen-and-paper aid. The paragraphs would have been conveyed better as a paper prototype (for example)	112	1	1	1	3
Inch: This scale is a bit overwhelming. I am not sure if the watch has enough pixels to deal with all of your screens. I think that for adding new due dates maybe the user could simply speak into the phone. I reallly like the first screen where is tells the user how much time they have spent working vs. having fun. I think it would also be helpful if the screen still showed the time of day. It may be helpful to have a screen that will buzz the user and let them know when they should move on to something else and when they should really get started on an assignment.	113	1	1	1	3
FOOT SCALE 1) There is no sense of visual hierarchy :(. There are too many images that are the same size, which could overwhelm the user. Personally, I didn't know what to pay attention to! Try to increase the size of the images and the current grid to reduce the number of images on the screen. 2) On the tabs at the top, try to utilize small, but salient icons to represent the different options. The reason for this is because humans process visuals 60,000 times faster than text. The small images could also be an effective point of entry! Whether or not you should keep the text on the tabs is up to you!	115	1	1	1	3
Yard: I like what is shown from far away but I would suggest changing the format from a calender to listing the upcoming events for the next week in a "fun" format. Maybe also listing what other people in the apartment are planning on cooking and exercises they plan to complete so that you can coordinate with them if you so choose. I would also suggets making the close up screen for two people where they can compare progress and also match up exercise schedules and cooking habits to see where they match. It could also create a little apartment competition to see who can improve the quickest in terms of healthy eating and exercise.	115	1	1	1	3
I feel like if Karen really wanted to procastinate or really didn't want to do the assignment, she could easily take those extra few steps. I feel like there should be a more concrete way of forcing her to stay focus and on task. This also bring up the issues that sometims bad websites can be used for good things while good websites can be used for bad things. For example, maybe Karen needs to use Facebook chat to talk to her teammates but Facebook is a social media website that is often distracting. Whereas something like TED might be really educational but might not pertain to the task at hand and might end up distracting her.	117	1	1	1	3
I like that you added the strap, especially the one over the top for support. Since people have different head shapes I would suggest making the straps adjustable either with somethign similar to a backpack strap or bra strap (just the plastic part for adjusting) or velcro (though it may not hold as well). For wearing glasses, it seems to work well but did you get feedback on how comfortable it was for a 20 minutes period? I know that if my glasses are pressed into my head it would start to give me a headache pretty qucikly. Overall I really love this design! Its so much better than holding the Google Cardboard up on your own.	117	1	1	1	3
the app is beautiful i love how yall went above and beyond to add images and animation i would be cautious about the number of text and images on the screen at a time a suggestion would be to turn each section of the project to be hidden in a button so a button to see the video pitch and a button to see the bio the main information is the fundraise and breakthrough so i would leave that outside and not hidden in the button of course you can format it the way that seems more reasonable to you and your users overall yall are doing great i cant wait to see your progress next week	117	1	1	1	3
I think generally this is very nice concept. When i go to the gym, i often find myself reading the instructions and the work area. However, not only does this make me look like a noob, but also its a little hard to keep on since there are so many machines out there. This interface can help me schedule different specific of workout and its very private. It would be nice to have something like: if you weight 160 then lift 200lb, how much is that going to affect you etc. Therefore, not only does this interface tells you where it will affect yopu but as well as how much ! (Of course, theres also diet, calories, cardio bounded to this.)	121	1	1	1	3
The fact that the buttons are on the bottm and represent specific parts of the paper is very helpful. I could see myself taking pages and pages of notes and I would not like to be scrolling through all of them in order to find the section I'm looking for. I like the simple functionality of those "tabs" or "bookmark" buttons to link me to specific areas. Furthermore, I really like the fact that the tablet is able to decipher the text and automatically partition the information. It makes my life a lot a lot easer in that situation. I could see a lot of students wanting to use this in class, where professors can be all over the place during lecture.	122	1	1	1	3
I wish there was an option to hide the hotekeys shortcut page since I imagine that the user will become well-versed in these shortcuts after a while and it isn't necessary to have them on the page. Maybe once that is hidden, the box with the slides could become bigger? Because right now, it is pretty tiny and considering the amount of text on some professor's slides, it would be really difficult to read the slide due to the size. Try posting some actual slides and see if you can read it easily. Also, is this designed for the laptop or the tablet? I take notes on my laptop at home but I usually take my tablet to class because it is lighter.	123	1	1	1	3
I like that it's possible to control certain features of the blocker, but I wonder that if it is on a phone, why not just make it a full app? I imagine that the inch scale would display some information even as a widget, just like how Google's home screen could display an icon of clouds to display weather. I like that the tablet view has a week view, but I think more space could be allocated for the daily schedule. For example, although the welcome is nice, it is not necessary for a utility app. The TV display seems similar to the tablet interface, which is good for consistency. Maybe display more than one person's schedule so that you can compare people's days?	124	1	1	1	3
Foot: I think that if Justin does to UCSD and didn't just move there he probably knows where to get food on his way home. Is this a personal foot screen or is it in the bus? It may be helpful if there was somehow a waterproof version attached to the bus stop (with the assumption no one can steal it). I feel like this scale could simply be google maps. It would be interesting if you could type in the main things you want to buy and it could direct you to the cheapest and best place along the bus route and show you the benefits of each option such as Vons takes 5 more minutes but the avacados are on sale for $1!	125	1	1	1	3
I like how the add-on is rather minimal, but personally as someone who codes in Vim for a lot of programming assignments I feel like sometimes I just need all the window space to look at my code, so maybe having a keyboard shortcut to hide the suggestions/make the suggestions reappear would be nice so it's not always so intrusive. I mention it more in content/functionality but like if my goal is just to finish my PA in time, then I'll learn the fitting command if I don't know it already, but otherwise I'm not too concerned about learning new Vim tricks. However if I'm trying to learn more Vim while coding, then I could just make it appear and hide it again if necessary.	125	1	1	1	3
I think this is a great idea. The fact that it is smart and will suggest commands that I have not used in a while is incredibly helpful. If I don't use a command in a while, I forget it and have to ask friends or look online for a reminder. With your upgrade, I am constantly reminded of old commands and they stay fresh in my head. I also like how users are able to provide feedback to VIM in terms of what they would like to improve. This openess is what would make me want to switch to this platform. The statistics at the bottm of the screen are also very helpful and informative. They are at the bottm and dont cause any distractions.	126	1	1	1	3
Yard: It is really helpful to know which bus route you should wait for and which will be faster based on arrival times. Great idea! The farther away screen is similar to the digital screens at the Gilman stop already but having a larger screen is helpful. It would be nice if when you got closer the screen would automatically sync with your typical route home and show you which bus you should take by highlighting it in red. It would also be cool if when multiple people step up to it it would show if the routes are simiar and maybe suggest sharing an uber if that would end up being much faster and only a few dollars since most people leaving campus live near each other.	128	1	1	1	3
Foot: Since I can't ask you about the design I am going to assume they are in the lecture at this point? If so there is no point to the slides on the screen since they can be viewed in the lecture hall. If the slides are synced with the slides on the screen it could be helpful for people that are running late to class so they can watch and hear the lecture in real time so they do not miss anything. I don't think there is a point to having the "Friends" part on the bottom since the user is already in class and can also check this on their phone, if anything I would suggest making it much smaller and just the names without the location.	129	1	1	1	3
I like this idea! I have the same problem. Some museums are so big it can be difficult to remember what you have seen. It would be interesting if you created an app that is similar to those hand held devices you can get at museums to guide you through it but simply on your phone where it can tell your location and something will pop on your phone asking if you want to learn about the painting nearby. Also you could make it where you can "like" the paintings which make it easy to find ones you saw. There could also be a list of the paintings you were "nearby" in the museum so if you forgot to like one you could go back and search through those.	129	1	1	1	3
There should also be a way to hide the transcript because I could see the transcript coming in really handy with certain professors but not so with other professors. Can the student record/save the transcript as well? I would also suggest adding a shortcut that would allow the student to highlight a certain point as extremely important. For example, sometimes professors will say "this is important" or "this will be on the exam" and it would be nice if the students could have a shortcut that would allow them to automatically highlight that entire bullet point so that they could refer back to it. Another would be a way for students to highlight points they have questions so that when they look through their notes, they could easily identify it.	130	1	1	1	3
i like how the updates tab informs the users that they shared a note make sure to include more messages to inform the user what they did and to also prevent errors if i saved a note inform me that i did so to meet the visibility of the system heuristic speaking about sharing will there be a button to share your notes how delete notes right now it looks like you can only save and like include a help button to inform your users how to use your app to meet the help and documentation heuristic lastly if it is important to your users include dates and owners of notes under the notes tab overall yall are heading the right direction i cant wait to see your progress next week	131	1	1	1	3
I like the problem you have choosen to tackle here since I have a lot of trouble finding good places to visit when I travel. I think a search bar would be really beneficial to your search index because maybe Megan is looking for something more specific like cold-brew coffee. Another thing is, I'm not sure if there are many people who would bring their iPad outside. Most people don't buy data for their iPads and so it relies on wifi which isn't stable outside in the streets. Also, I imagine when visiting a big city like Manhanttan, waving around an iPad may invite unwanted attention from pickpockets and theives. It also really highlights who is a local and who is a tourist and that can actually bring up some safety issues.	132	1	1	1	3
I like the idea of having all of this information in one space but It is a bit overwhelming at the moment. I would recommend having a bar on the top or sides that the user can switch between which shows different aspects such as one for rate my professor and CAPS and another for the current schedule. I think it would be helpful to narrow it down by having a page for all requirements left to graduate and then letting the user choose which ones they wish to complete in the given quarter and then directing them to a page which shows course potential offerings that match the requirements. I also think the top left "waitlist/plan" should be moved below the time and date of the course so the relevant information is above.	134	1	1	1	3
Inch: I really like this scale tells you the name of the bus stop and how long you have left on the bus, as well as an alarm when it is time to get off. This would be really helpful in foreign countries! I can't tell if the arrow in the 4th to 6th image is directing you or not but that would be extremely helpful. This is especially true when the faster route to school might be a bus that is slightly farther away that you have never taken before. I am not entirely sure what the "use closeset bus stop" is. Is it a button or an option or automatically taken? It may not always be best to take the closest bus stop especially when it comes to nobel and regents vs lebon and regents (but lebon does get passed alot with full buses).	146	1	1	1	3
It is really unfortunate that your pictures are broken no matter how many times I refresh the website, so I can only see your design through your videos. For the inch design, it looks like it is designed for a breaking newsm so that the watch will vibrates when there is a breaking news pushed to the device (correct me if I get it wrong, because there is so little information for me to see what is really going on there). But first I don't see why it shows up a time-like number when you press the 'breaking'? I thought it would pops up the article that has the breaking news. Secondly, it is bad idea to pops out an article or any sort of content relates to the publication on inch scale, because it is nearly impossible to read any texts longer than a short message.	147	1	1	1	3
One of the problems is that all 3 UIs do the exact same thing - select a location in the world, and explore that site. Try to branch out into different tasks/use cases for each UI, such as how will multiple people use the display at the same time for the yard scale? Maybe with multiple controllers they can specify/vote on places, or request to not visit specific places, or a place that matches all of their interests will be provided so they are all satisfied. The inch scale struggles the most from not really getting to immerse yourself in the place because the display is so small, so I'd focus on something else, such as maybe the audio functionalities (imagine a narrator describing the scene at each of these places around the world, such as being an excavator digging for a skeleton in the hot summer desert)	148	1	1	1	3
I like that the app is not cluterred. It is meant to be an organizational tool, so the simplicity of the app really pleases me. The tablet is smart so it is able to learn and made adjustments to the formatting of the material. The app gives a lot of space for the user to be able to write, which is really convenient. It has some buttons on the bottom of the screen, which do not get in the way of the user writing. It creates quick buttons that correspond to specific sections of the material, which I would find very useful. I do wish that it would give a few options of how it believes that you want your notes to be organized. Maybe put some ornaizational style examples and have the app shift the information around based on what type of organizational syle or hierachy the user prefers.	150	1	1	1	3
the app is simple which is good i think it makes your app easy to learn and use there were some dead ends and dead links so make sure to fix those for next weeks iteration some notes currently the add group button is hidden in the menu and should be more visible addition of back buttons would allow users to easily maneuver around your app adding messages to inform your users of what they did would allow the users to be aware of the system visibility of the system heuristic and prevent errors error prevention heuristic for example if i addeddeleted a group the system should ask for confirmation and then let me know what i did i also understand that yall are having trouble formatting your app so please come by to office hours for some help overall it looks great cant wait to see your progress next week	151	1	1	1	3
there are a few bugs with your app so please make sure to fix that before user testing some design recommendations class info can show quarter and year notes can show amount of dislikes and likes and name of the app should be seen throughout the app not seen when creating or viewing a note make sure to keep nielsens heuristics in mind users can make a lot of errors with your app so add some helpful messages when logging out deleting a task unfollowing a class adding the wrong credentials for logging in and entering an empty task i can see the error message in the console but not on the app itself lastly as much as i think the url of your app is unique try to get a new url with your app name before user testing overall i think your app flows well and straightforward good job	151	1	1	1	3
I think that past quarter information should be on a different page. Like I stated above, this is a bit overwhelming. I don't think that the user needs their GPA, name, college, id, etc. on a top bar _ the user knows who they are. Maybe there could be a list of the requirements they are currently able to complete instead of showing a graph and listing all of them in the center. I feel like each block you have created should be a different page. It is nice to have all of the items readily available but that doesn't mean they should all be clustered together. I suggest: 1. A page that shows the top right block, with the bottom left calender and the capes reviews. 2. A page with all of the courses that have been completed, courses needed to be completed and the graph of what courses can be completed.	153	1	1	1	3
This is a really great setup! I also used to do some graphic design some years back and I used a very similar setup. The fact that he uses a tablet to do his main work is a very good idea, rather than using the touchscreen on his computer. I also really like that since he is right handed, he keeps the monitor to the left of his Wacom tablet. This prevents him from accidentally hitting it with his elbow as he is drawing. Furthermore, he is able to use his left hand to type on the keyboard. I also like that he is playing videos in the background. This way he can be more relaxed and feel greater comfortability as he is getting in the flow of his work. Having reference material on the monitor is also a great idea. This allows him to get small bits of inspiration as he continues to illustrate.	155	1	1	1	3
2 another idea it was interesting to see how meticulous some people were and that they were frustrated because of the lack of a good way to track their nutrition intake for that matter i think an interesting angle might be to look at the daily nutrition intake history and compute the delta between each data point thus leveraging and reflecting human homeostasis into the process of meal preparation probably a somewhat longer term in this case like preparing meals for the entire week for example this might lead to an interesting design idea that might not just visualize each cooking event as its own but also as part of a bigger group 2 to 3day cooking window for example if you are interested you might want to further observe people and how they might change their course of action provided that they have information about the nutritional intake of the past over time other than that great job	159	1	1	1	3
The video link is broken, so I am basing this on your written description. The content of your idea is very practical. My friends and I regularly use sites like Slick Deals in order to find the best value. I realy appreciate an app alerting me on new deals. T-Mobile does this on Tuesdays through their app and I have been jumping on those deals, so I know this works! I also really like the fact that the app is smart enough to purchase items for you. Sometimes items run out of stock and it would be great if the app would buy it for you before it runs out. I would like to see if maybe the app can ask you if you would like to buy the item though. Or if the app can check your bank account to see if you have enough money. It would be horrible to get an overdraft fee due to this app!	160	1	1	1	3
Inch: Conceptually I think this is an interesting idea, however I do not think that an inch scale device is ideal for viewing images of anything. If you are on the bus, why not use your phone or a tablet that provides a larger scale? Foot: For the foot scale, I think that the use case is much more proper. However, your use case states that the user wants to check something out in Greece. Why give all the options for places around the globe or additional places that the user doesn't want, like Jordan? Maybe provide an interface before this screen that allows the user to select where they want, it animates in on the map and doesn't show other places. Yard: Seems to me like you mostly reused the foot interface for the yard. Watching videos/viewing content on a yard scale is obviously ideal but I think you can come up with more intuitive interactions than using a game controller.	162	1	1	1	3
On the sign in page, the spacing is off, it definitely shouldn't have so much room for the Username/Password especially compared to the rest of the screen. The donor/recipient option probably should be two large buttons , instead of small checkin boxes as opposed to the much larger Sign in/Sign up buttons Assuming this is an app for mobile devices, check boxes in general are kind of hard to work with since they're small, but either two buttons / dropdowns could work as well. On page 2, the sign in button at the bottom's rather small, which always tends to be a problem with a lot of mobile apps (it might want to be near the top, since the user's going to check there first, and either they already know they need to make another account or they'll just login) On the Your Donations page it's not clear which option is curerntly selected between Current Donations, Past Donations, and Tax Write-Offs (perhaps highlight/bold whichever one its currently defaulted to?)	169	1	1	1	3
Verification email should probably have a go to home option because right now the only option is to refresh the app. The donation page's + Donation button should be much larger when there's no current donations, to fill up the space We discussed this in class too on Thursday, but for quantity/deductions there should probably be number incrementer/decrementer options/dropdown menus, especially for common items which tend to be more of a flat dollar option or whatnot. Deductions/category should probably be automatically calculated, and the "Not What you expected" is probably honestly an edge case since it shouldn't be that often that this occurs, so up to you if you want to address this specific edge case or not. For Homeless Shelter matching I think your app should automatically match a homeless shelter based on the needs of the shelter, the preferences of the user/location, and what the user's giving away, which would make it much easier and you could even fit it into the previous screen. (The user should confirm donation only after picking a recipient)	176	1	1	1	3
For the inch design, I really like the large text and the green color you used to signify progress. The color filling of the shoes is genius, it gives a great visual of the progress the person is making! My only question is, where would the user input what the number of their steps "goal" is? For the foot design, The large graphic is great since it gives a clear view of what the different muscles are. Furthermore, the vertical menu makes great use of limited space. The tabs below also keep the information very compact, while offering a lot to the user. Also for the foot, I like how the interface takes the trouble of subdividing body areas out of the user's hands and guides them towards finding more workouts. The yard design offers tons of information and is very easy to read. The "wave to connect" feature is a really good idea, but as a user, I would have a difficult time being drawn to that area of text. Maybe add an image to draw the user's attention to that area.	183	1	1	1	3
Great idea! A smart wallet with the functionality of Mint would definitely be a great idea to restrain spending/encourage the user to budget wisely. However, one potential problem I can see with the usage is often the decision is made to eat/go somewhere before even paying (i.e. I only pay after I've eaten food at a restaurant, not before I make that decision to go to a restaurant with friends, which would save money). For example, if the user overspends their budget in half a month for food, is the Smart Wallet supposed to lock them out and prevent them from spending any more money this month on food? (this leads to circumvention/the app wouldn't work ideally) One cool potential thing could be if this app somehow knew the user's intentions (or maybe at times when the user is likely to go out and spend money it can recommend ideas/suggestions, sorta like the angel/devil on your shoulder) That way it could encourage decision making from the get-go, in addition to showing the user's progress (or guilt tripping them) on how much they've spent recently	184	1	1	1	3
Inch: I like the idea of being able to see how well you've slept using the watch interface but I do not think setting alarms for sleeping through the watch is a good interface, it would be easier to simply have the alarms sync from the phone. I like that you can see what you planned for breakfast to help the user stick to their planned (healthier?) choices but I don't think you need a yes or no for breakfast unless this is meant for tracking? In which case you would want the user to be able to say what they ended up having if it is different, maybe through speaking into the watch? This may just be me but in terms of drinking water your body should know when you are thirsty. If the point is to track what the user has had to drink that is a different story. It is also the same with snacks, I think it is a bit strange to have a designated snack time since it is healthier to eat the snack when hungry. (I may be misunderstanding this.	186	1	1	1	3
good job in polishing the app i can see lots of effort has been put into linking everything together and implementing interactivity at every corner of the app i like the detailorientedness however some of the interaction felt a little redundant meaning that there are various ways to achieve the same goal of navigation for example it could have pros and cons but one of the cons would be that it might overload the mental model of the firsttime user as it the flow of interaction does not feel very much linear i stressed firsttime as it might also be true for more advanced users to find that interactivity and detail handy i think its ultimately up to the design teams choice to cut down to which level of focusing on details and implementing interactivity 1 point was rewarded for your overall hard work of polishing the app and finishing the project thank you for an awesome quarter you guys rocked enjoy the winter break and hope you earned some insight and inspiration from this course hope you a great new start for whatever youre trying to achieve next	189	1	1	1	3
I really like the idea of putting tape on the areas people touch their faces to. I think it would be nice if the original package provided a sheet of stickers meant to be placed over the area where a person's face touches it. I believe that would be a very cheap option that works and people have the option to add it or not (It all would'nt really add to the manufacturing time of the device since the user does it themselves). In class we talked about adding a strap instead of the glasses feature. A strap does seem like a better option such as a ski mask, this way a user's glasses can fit inside and it will be more comfortable for the user nto having the hwole device resting on their ears. I would also suggets a strap over the top of the head to distribute the weight better. It might be interesting to make it so that as with snowboarding goggles the user could attach the glasses to a helmet (only if wanted, obviously expensive if the user does nto own a helmet, but could be nice for demoing to a large group of people.) As Kelmmer suggested, if may be nice to create another size for children though that may not be necessary for your specific case).	222	1	1	1	3

Overall, I like the idea! Maybe have price comparison between brands of the same item.	15	1	1	0	2
price should also be shown in this pop up window. Case of recognition vs. recall.	15	1	1	1	3
The feedback indicating the user is close to attaining their goal is helpful and intuitive	15	1	0	0	1
Upon an increase in score, a short animation or sound could add to the experience?	15	1	1	1	3
You should a specific task for the persona to accomplish instead of introducing the interface.	15	1	1	0	2
the first two activities dont clearly describe breakdowns it talks about needs without describing breakdowns first	16	1	0	1	2

try to be more explicit about how it relates to shaking up status quo otherwise good work	17	1	1	0	2
adding a task only works partially and appears to be the most important part of the app	17	1	0	0	1
try to phrase the needs for a typical user rather than specific people and not by name	17	1	1	0	2
similar to the first prototype there are missing interactions how would you add a company for instance	17	1	0	1	2
also please adapt it as a mobile web app if you plan to go ahead with this	17	1	1	0	2
organizing tasks is too broadly phrased to give a good idea what the app assists in doing	17	1	0	1	2
the first storyboard should have used a thicker instrument its just not the same with a pen	17	1	1	1	3
its good to be comprehensive but i barely see what you might want to specifically test out	17	1	0	1	2
details about the data collected are fuzzy if you can clarify im happy to restore this point	17	1	1	1	3
online resources can be used to verify your results but the actual chisquare formula should be shown	17	1	1	0	2
theres no expected value calculation for the noclick condition and therefore the derived chisquared value is incorrect	17	1	0	1	2
you need to collect more facets of information on this screen to stay within the brief nontaboo	17	1	1	1	3
the wireframe images are pretty blurry so its difficult to see a lot of the finer details	17	1	0	1	2
a single screen is shown but even that wasnt completely explained otherwise the point wouldve been yours	17	1	0	1	2
its alright to be a little messy sometimes but make sure that you communicate completely and concisely	17	1	1	0	2
pov could probably be expanded on a bit more with why people arent motivated enough to exercise	17	1	1	0	2
storyboard 3 needs to have a little more detail about how the user interacts with the app	17	1	1	0	2

Love the concept! However, is there a way of keeping track of the specific commands you've learned?	17	1	0	0	1
Maybe intergrating third-party platforms such as google doc and help user to complete coursework within your app.	17	1	1	0	2

this is too simplistic an idea to pursue for a long enough project as this well executed though	18	1	0	1	2

the 1st and 3rd storyboards a little too vague to be able to come up with prototype ideas	18	1	0	1	2
Consider to increase the contrast on the "altitude"? The light green color might not be clear under sunlight	18	1	1	1	3
design is nice - minimalist, though some screens could use some restructuring to make use of excessive whitespace	18	1	1	1	3
Foot scale - minimalist, simple design is good, I like the icon style and general use of space	18	1	0	0	1
For the location, I think maybe the "map view" will be a good choice to visualize the data	18	1	1	0	2
Great idea because sitting all day at an 8 to 5 can be very hard on our bodies.	18	1	0	1	2
I like how the user can personalize a lot of options, improving the emotional design of the app.	18	1	0	1	2
I like that you can view the time slots and can RSVP for a certain washer or dryer!	18	1	0	0	1
I like the circular interface for displaying the dealine. It is a great visual representation of time data.	18	1	0	1	2
I like the color scheme, I prefer dark colors so its not so bright, but maybe less neon.	18	1	1	1	3
I like the inch scale use of space. I wish the foot scale can provide more historic information.	18	1	1	0	2
I like the watch design with boxes. However, the sliders seems to refined for such a small interface.	18	1	0	1	2

It is better not place the number on top of the logo because it may affect the readablity.	18	1	1	1	3
Probably you can make the clickable buttons more visable. Such as adding some shadow around the box, etc	18	1	1	0	2
Really like the watch interface - the speed number is huge - great design for a small screen	18	1	0	1	2
The Add Message modules are a bit confusing . Too many choices a user needs to click on!	18	1	0	1	2

some of the functionality is unclear what else can the app do besides have the user input dog info	19	1	1	1	3
Also maybe adding some feedback system from the crowd? Like a upvote/downvote feature to get some feedback from audience?	19	1	1	1	3
Good use of broad domains as well as some that are a little more specific to find lead users.	19	1	0	1	2

I think there are too many colors, you could take away the red and the interface would do fine	19	1	1	0	2
I wish the empty spaces were completely used. Make the interface full screen instead of half of the screen.	19	1	1	0	2
I'm a little confused, are the 2 different interfaces or they are just one but very smart interface ?	19	1	0	1	2
Not sure what the rectangles on the side are supposed to represent, maybe this space could be used better	19	1	1	0	2
Overall the design is very clean and I think it will be useful to people who want to donate!	19	1	0	0	1

it might be useful to emphasize through the test the importance of collaborating with your garden members to maintain the quality of your garden	24				0
point of view should be a single concise statement that captures the needs of all users rather than explaining the need for each user	24				0
there is no description of unique interactions in addition these interactions are not unique to this app and are found in most budgeting apps	24				0
there is scope to have the activity log do more than merely show the history ie how would users want to learn from it	24				0
overall some interesting ideas for a unique topic it will be interesting to see how you explore translating this digital game with the realworld	24				0
i recommend you only change one of the options to checkboxes rather than the whole page it will be easier to test this way	24				0
saving a workout takes you back to the home page which is unexpected also editing inputs with a keyboard is not the best idea	24				0
the check boxes could have side effects such as moving those suggestions down or highlighting them differently to make it more apparent to users	24				0
feel free to use a plan that actually works for you this is not for us but to help your group work things out	24				0
actually, maybe your system can be starter and it can automatically choose the correct mode for certain environment. You can set it as default.	24				0
Hey there ! Great work. I have trouble opening the LFG tool. I'm not sure if this is on my part or the critiquekit.	24				0
I like how the interface takes the trouble of subdividing body areas out of the user's hands and guides them towards finding more workouts	24				0
I like the interface design for the interface. I wish I can "bookmark"/"save" some common settings for the lighting to get some quick access.	24				0
I pretty much like your idea. But the interface for multiple windows does not quite look good. Why are those screens tweaked like that?	24				0
I think if you're including seat # information, your persona would appreciate seats taken, and a visual representation of where there are available seats.	24				0
I think that you did great needfinding but I wish I could see more design in your prototype, like what's holding the tablet up.	24				0
I'm confused as to how this is a lead user solution. Does evreyone face this issue and how does your user hack the problem?	24				0
In the foot face. I think there should be a price shown under the Recommended Products, rather than after I click on the "compare".	24				0
Inch scale - buttons, elements, and text are all far too small. Consider reducing the task able to be completed on the inch scale.	24				0
Initially it's hard to break into because it's a lot going on. I think that the type of noises are good in different colors.	24				0
It would be nice, if this text didnt protrude into the chart section and was onlu restricted to left of the thick grey line	24				0
Probabaly you can add more information about the event that relative to transportation, for example, the location of the event, the distance and etc.	24				0
The task seems quite vague - come up with a concrete scenario in which the UI is driven by the lead user's specific need	24				0
This looks really good! I'm not certain how useful the I'm feeling lucky feature is and I don't think people care about past reservations.	24				0
Unable to access the PDF -- I've tried contacting the user and getting permission to access the file. Will update once I get access.	24				0
When someone is new to football game, it is better to clear the meaning of numbers for the yard scale interface on the top.	24				0
YARD SCALE 1) I like how the app displays deals based on the user's life. This adds a sense of personalization to the app.	24				0
what about when the user clicks outside the input field and then clicks back make sure not to count erroneously and use the appropriate test	25	1	1	0	2
some unique features stated seemed to be visible but not implemented such as allowing users to sign nda disclosure scientist receiving funds and filtering projects	25				0
you ought to have included more of the calculations as shown in the slides rather than just a line of calculation which i cant understand	25				0
calendar page is secondary functionality pick more data visualizations to wizard of oz but implement the capacity to collect the data that would drive them	25				0
there should be one single point of view that captures the needs for all your users rather than a point of view for each person	25				0
point of view should be a concise statement that captures a single reason for all users point awarded because i think you caught the sentiment	25				0
when i complete a task and then refresh the page the tasks i completed reappear and the number of tasks left to complete never changes	25				0
the instructions should better emphasize the personal food and mood tracking aspect the instructions still make it seem like the pet is of more importance	25				0
would inputting a specific mbti type will terminally remove all other people of incompatible types what if users still would like to see other people	25				0
your app works perfectly well with no errors and also has some nice interactions youd have gotten more extracredit points had you implemented more interactions	25				0
interesting pov focused on the logging data inputting aspect of your daily diet and activity i look forward to seeing how the project would evolve	25				0
some of the needs are very similar it would have been interesting to consider different types of job seekers to get varied and distinct needs	25				0
not sure if your latest changes were pushed because much of the functionality you mentioned completing in your development plan was not in the app	25				0
point awarded but the tasks should be centered around the different assignments weektoweek so you can ensure that you meet all rubric and assignment requirements	25				0
it isnt clear for which of your users you have written notes for you need to write a separate set of notes for each one	25				0
the changes are more appropriately filling in gaps in the previously incomplete prototype that is not the intent as heuristic violations are not being rectified	25				0
oh i see the map now make it more easily accessible im hesitant to give this point because it still feels like its missing something	25				0
your app is beautifully designed and the core functionality appears to be implemented for the most part moreover the interaction appears to be almost seamless	25				0
Custom modifications to mechanical keyboards beyond keycap replacement certainly fall under the domain of "lead users", I'm curious to see how your design turns out.	25				0
Generally, I think of clicking as trying to see more details not add. You may want a separate "+" button for adding to your schedule	25				0
Hmm. While this makes sense...I think the text is getting lighter too quickly. If anything I think maybe making the size smaller makes more sense.	25				0
How does a percentage tell the user how their posture is suffering? Seems to not be a very direct or even accurate measure of posture	25				0
I didn't think the dot, dash, and box intuitively represents stressful activities, comments, and relaxing activities. Maybe you could look at icons that fit better?	25				0
I don't quite like your font type. And although the digit is large enough to say, I can barely see the little text underneath it.	25				0
I like how different keys on the keyboard contain different types of switches - allowing for alternative types of feedback based on the key hit.	25				0
I like how it shows the price per time. I also really like how it shows the different parking spots and how far it is.	25				0
I like how useful this design is to your user but I wish that there were more functionality shown in the prototype with the screens.	25				0
I like the simiplicity and organization of the app. I wish there was more space for the key topic and less for the other resources.	25				0
I like your idea of demoing human body in the public display that makes it clear to see which part of body is going well	25				0
I like your scenario. I thought you decided no longer doing the Tijuana thing though, nice to see you coming back to your original design	25				0
I really like your idea. Maybe there is a way to add in a better gauge of if the user is hitting the marks correctly.	25				0
I think that the foot scale could be better explained in your persona. Would it be used only before? or during the massage as well?	25				0
INCH SCALE 1) Instead of having text on the 2nd screen, maybe you could use voice output to guide the user throughout his shopping route.	25				0
It would be nice to know the model and color of the car, kind of like Uber. So you know which is the right car	25				0
Overall I really like the idea. Consider that ther could be a bigger difference between the yard and inch functionality. Be creative on the yard!	25				0
Really like the design! I wish the app can have a tracking feature showing a visualization of my time distribution and my progress on sleeping.	25				0
Try changing the buttons on the yard scale. I think they mock real life too much, but will be hard to control in that way.	25				0
not a real interpretation you need to provide an explanation as to why the test turned out the way it did even if it isnt correct	26	1	1	0	2
a prototype is complete in itself it is not any particular page as a result i have to dock points for the second prototype entirely unfortunately	26	0	0	1	1
appears to be incomplete try to see how you could help the persona with an app if possible and indicate the result that makes her happy	26				0
take a more insightful stance this one just cuts it as there is some direction to guide decisions also storyboards dont focus on the motivation part	26				0
the rubric mentions describing a core problem without offering a solution your pov has a set of possible solutions reviews of dining hall food splitting receipts	26				0
its unclear whether i have done the task correctly is this just adding a task also is there a way to assign tasks to specific people	26				0
i wish the pov contained a little more context as to what it is about keeping the memories that is currently missing from the observed users	26				0
your user needs are a bit too specific it would help to generalize the need a slight bit so that you may address a bigger audience	26				0
great job finishing most of the features rewarded two point for implementing the tag filtering feature as well as the time measurement and animation in checkpoints	26				0
the interactions that you mention are not implemented how would you facilitate communication a chat system how would you handle money logistics including a base price	26				0
it would have been great if the pov contained some explanation as to what specifically is the implication of having different attitudes towards using these apps	26				0
because you are using an outside library please put in comments with keywords like json so that i can see where your data io functionality is	26				0
after checking your development plan i decided not to award your team the point because there were no changes or additional tasks in the new version	26				0
i wish there was some way for the app to know where i am how did the app know that gobind needed a seat in geisel	26				0
i like the side navigation i suggest researching if the order should be changed perhaps by importance is chatting more important than chores in your app	26				0
analyzing other existing banking apps might provide some insights to latent design opportunities but i think graphically associating spending with some memory is an interesting idea	26				0
navigation feels tedious due to the hamburger menu since these arent pages one would go to infrequently and instead seem to be important to the app	26				0
Adding a social feature to the spp such as leaderboard might also be useful. Peer pressure and gamification can improve motivation of keep using the app.	26				0
How come the tablet would know user's current posture? It might be better to be tutorial site that teaches how to relax body (like yoga instructions..)	26				0
I dont belive the sound output from a watch would be sufficient to notify surrounding people. Emitting it from a different source would be more effective	26				0
I like the map function and seeing all the attractions and different hostels at once. I would imagine it might be difficult once outliers are introduced.	26				0
I like the organization and I wonder if there is anything skeumorphic that you can do with this interface where you have more icons of food.	26				0
I think it is hard to put four buttons in the same screen on smart watch and users may eaily press the wrong button by mistake.	26				0
I think there is a lot of potential for needs here. Let's think about what kind of need that lead users of this product could use	26				0
I wish I can receive voice feedback for the popup issues -- in some cases, user might not be able to directly look at the display	26				0
I wish there are more ways to interact with the screen. And as said in class, the seating area colors needs to be decided more carefully.	26				0
I wish you can put the introduction of the app in the login page and you do not need the about button at the top bar.	26				0
If comments, likes, etc. are important to this user then your design would possibly make these features clear visually appealing to the user reading the article.	26				0
It would be fun to also include some different sort methods such as by 'items rarely used' since your lead user expressed concerns about forgetting items.	26				0
Really like this task control interface - consider to add more contrast to the icon? Read on grey might not be clear enough on certain backgrounds?	26				0
Since all the player is doing is adding or subtracting numbers to their score, perhaps using a different functionality would be more intuitive (e.g., slide right/left).	26				0
This idea is pretty cool - I've seen it implemented in games such as Fallout 4, which contain extensive lists of items across many different categories.	26				0
Very handy! Maybe you could design an app that scans in the receipt and makes a list of items bought and displays it on the fridge?	26				0
Yard: I like that it takes into account the person's profile since that's definitely a struggle with finding guests if there are many of them waiting.	26				0
apart from the main idea in the storyboard to make sense of job emails there is a lot that can be done to make a complete app	27	1	0	0	1

please make sure to select the right pages from the pdf that correspond to the question i have fixed it to show what we would usually expect	27				0
ps looking at your live page it seems that you intended to offer activity choices solid bullet points are not a clear lowfi representation of radio buttons	27				0
the profile page says training topic so im confused as to what the exact purpose of this page is does this fit under the training tab instead	27				0
i wish the login pagesplash page had a statement that explains the goal of your app healthnet can be about anything for example linkedin connect to opportunity	27				0
i think your idea fits the theme well and i think you did a good job taking note of the breakdowns and successes that your interviewees encountered	27				0
the app is functional with no dead ends and it has clearcut features the app seems simple enough to learn and use which is a great thing	27				0
the needs should be based on the user not the system ill give you the point but you should be thinking from more from the user perspective	27				0
a list format for these changes would not only make it easier to read but would provide you with an overview of how to prioritize these changes	27				0
i can see what you wrote came from your observations but they are not really needs ill still give you the point since it is close enough	27				0
points 345 are the same but in a differing context all of them are i wish i could get reviews of x by people whove used x	27				0
i believe user profile view isnt completely functional the redo task button or clicking the add button on the homepage doesnt change anything on the profile page	27				0
Add the location information in the inch interface because watch will vibrate when user gets close to certain dining hall. The location info matters at this time.	27				0
And I am not sure what Lead User's creative part is. It looks like sending message is a thing that most people would do in that situtation.	27				0
Being about to find area without surge can definitely be a good idea. However, the idea need to employ more design thinking to make it more helpful.	27				0
Foot: I like that you can see the relevant info right away (number and time remaining)! It's great that you can see the menu as you're waiting.	27				0
For the transcript section, I would like to automatically have dates and 'important information' highlighted and possibly moved to a new location within the note taking app.	27				0
Great job in providing a digest of the tasks for the next day. This does a good job of putting ones schedule in context of their todo's	27				0
How does it calculate what time to sleep based on previous patterns? If you've slept few hours does it try to compensate by having you sleep more?	27				0
I like the design in the shoe, it is very creative. I think that the skethes could be a little more clear in order to show more.	27				0
I like the functionality because I find it hard to take notes. I wish that it could drag snippets from the links into under the key topic.	27				0
I really like the idea - in what way are the grocery lists synchronized with the app? via receipt or some sort of other itemized store list?	27				0
I wish you can put the search bar and the overview on top of the side bar since they are the most frequently elements to look at.	27				0
I wonder if a map would be hard to read. Maybe it would be better to display zones/aisles? or just the instructions of Go Forward 3 minutes.	27				0
If your intention is to reserve a room I don't see the option to do that here. Unless this is time remaining on the room you have?	27				0
Inch interface is too much for an iWatch interface. I recommend giving it one function only, or putting these features into a widget instead of an iwatch.	27				0
Love your idea !! It would be nice to see some interface on the board. For example: maybe put some settings on their, snapshot, things like that.	27				0
Probably make use of the haptic feedback and that can be a huge user experience improvement and reduce the problem of looking at the watch while snowboarding	27				0
Visually the design is very clean but I do think it is hard to read the orange font on a white background, especially at a far distance	27				0
1 point penalty for late submission it was after 2 am i can consider the 107 am submission to be on time but looks like it wasnt complete	28	0	0	1	1
good job in filling the functionality gap over the past few weeks but i think theres still some potential to improve the aesthetics and interaction of the app	28				0
it might be useful to have interview questions at the end of your test so you can gather good insights about what your user thought about your app	28				0
the idea of visualizing the progress of saving money is novel there might be a way to make it more distinctive and thus letting your app stand out	28				0
it didnt seem like there was a clear solution at the end of the storyboard because the user was still ignoring the timer again avoid making a timer	28				0
there are tad bits that can be enhanced for example there is a downward arrow in the my tasks page which is hard to know the functionality of	28				0
conveying emotions in artifacts photos videos text is a very interesting design space good job but the link between your observation to the need statements is somewhat weak	28				0
the design of the activity is interesting but its exploration connected to the pov is limited what other pain points scenarios do people have in managing their finances	28				0
because your app assumes the existence of two smart watches i think it would have been great if you could include interaction through them as well while testing	28				0
lots of confusion and misunderstanding observed from the users its a good time to think about how the app is structured around user scenarios and redesign if necessary	28				0
FOOT SCALE 1) You should include an "Other" tab on the top because every grocery store sells different items. This tab could cover snacks, alcohol, baked goods, etc..	28				0
Foot: I like the status bar but I think it is somewhat visually unappealing and you may want to change it to a color gradient across the bar.	28				0
I like the idea of a visual overlay for instruction - its quite similar to the production effects that a sports network would do during a replay analysis	28				0
I like the interface but why doesn't the video mode go to full screen and what is the purpose of the grey background taking up so much space?	28				0
I like the simplicity of the watch app. I'm not sure why the user would need to see their HR though esp if they're trying to fall asleep.	28				0
I like your attempt at making the product more hygenic, that's is aboslutely an issue as more and more people use the product so identifying that is big.	28				0
I wish it is more high resolution and true to scale. I don't know if it's just like this on my laptop or is it just like this.	28				0
I'm a little confused as to why Google Maps is her hack. Unless she takes the information from Hostels/Facebook/Yelp and then use Google maps to cross-reference her choices.	28				0
If the app's main goal is to help gamers get enough sleep, then maybe the app could set up a recommended alarm clock time to wake up to?	28				0
If you were to create an app, you could display the items using a grid. To add, you could also highlight the uncommon items, like on the receipt.	28				0
Inch scale - I like the simple, minimalist design--however, is the temperature a necessary statistic to display when dealing with light energy savings? Consider removing for more space	28				0
Make sure to clean up the minor textual errors for Tuesday (You have second floor twice in the yard design), and Muir College Apt might be too vague	28				0
Really good set up of problem, however, I believe for this asignment we were supposed to identify a lead user who has already come up with a solution.	28				0
Showing how the different sections compete for who is able to start the wave is a little unclear and I am not sure if it would really work.	28				0
Tag transcript sounds really good! Like having a way to know what time in the lecture you need to recheck later makes a lot of sense to me.	28				0
Voice is a good way as a input in inch size. However, it should be more intuitive to tell users what users can say to control the system.	28				0
please plan one week in advance so that progress can be compared also include development tasks other than those strictly required by the assignment such as any bugs fixed	29				0
take a more concrete stance this one gives a little insight but no direction also the jump from necessary belongings to whattowear can be considered fairly arbitrary without justification	29				0
someone else cant come up with a distinct prototype from with the pov just from looking at the storyboard if the storyboard itself contains the working of the prototype	29				0
there is scope to make it much better given how rich your observations are think deeper and dont let your personal bias if any guide the point of view	29				0
try to phrase needs in a more general manner even though they should relate to your observations they shouldnt specifically talk about those or the subjects esp by name	29				0
on a different note how would you handle the case when the app cannot suggest a group immediately maybe because not many people have signed up for one yet	29				0
the point of view doesnt seem to capture the real reason of why people are not good at cooking why do they not already understand their kitchen and tools	29				0
i think you should focus on the fact that there is greater contextual information that is constantly changing as i think that is the unique value of your app	29				0
i like how patients can sign in as a guest it is unclear if a scientist or investor can sign in as a guest should they be able to	29				0
some of these are featurelike and hence sound like solutions such as enroll in one click what you probably mean is that it should be an intuitive simple process	29				0
im sure youve realized by now but you are leaning towards treating the user like a subject also productivity apps are overdone so you need to keep distinguishing yourself	29				0
most of these needs were to focused on the tools used for navigation or physical features should focus instead on user confusion or how they react to confusing directions	29				0
while its fully functional im certain your team can actually implement the feature of tracking a persons movement along the routes without that your app is only half baked	29				0
the skill of playing a game outside of cooking does not translate to actually cooking how can you bridge this gap more how can you augment the cooking experience	29				0
i would just do one of the 2 options so that you can guarantee that your results are based off of one change rather than a multitude of factors	29				0
i felt bad to deduct another point here for the same reason as the last week but you were supposed to include both weeks development plans side by side	29				0
the race idea is creative but this still relies heavily on a timer component a more interesting area is how can we encourage productivity without the use of timing	29				0
prototype doesnt seem to show full interactions also from this overview it just seems like an app to input budget info what makes this different from things like mint	29				0
for anything that is only to be submitted trial watermarks are just fine however if it has to be presented try to use other free tools that arent noticeable	29				0
its good that youre taking inspiration from strava but be careful not to make an app too similar to strava what can you do instead to set yourself apart	29				0
i wish the app had a visible timer you can test if a visible timer that counts up or down motivates people to stay focused on their assigned task	29				0
2) On the 4th screen of the inch scale, what happens if bars or tables are not available? Would the interface only display one of the options? or both?	29				0
As the final presentation, you can include the screen of presentation, which allow users to go through the video when they are taking note without going to another page.	29				0
Especially at the inch scale, I think the design looks very simple and organized. All of the information that one would need is clearly displayed at an appropriate scale.	29				0
For future iterations, could it be possible to draw out other functions? I don't play the game but there should be space for more interaction outside of the game.	29				0
For the watch interface, if the breathing and heartbeat of the user is good, then the text or image should turn green, indicating that the user's state is positive.	29				0
I like that there is a separate beginning workflow for drivers but I wish it were not so small so maybe you can make the driver's entry part bigger.	29				0
I like the idea of giving someone more creative and interactive tools, Im a little lost so more detail woud be great, but it seems like an interesting topic	29				0
I like the idea of improving one of Snapchat's flaws, but how much more creative can you be when designing an interface/interaction for this? Just something to think about!	29				0
I like your idea and I can see how important this can be for people in such a situation, both for EMTs and people asking help for real emergency.	29				0
I think that the interface has a lot of functionality but I was wondering if you could add options to fill out or add more tax write up forms.	29				0
I wish you can categorize buttons or screens by funtionality and it is better for users to get the visual guide immediatly to familirize the control without much training.	29				0
I would like a physical time left during the game or maybe something that tracks time. It would be helpful to know how long each game is on average.	29				0
I'm not sure whether there will be a privacy problem for the yard interface becasue not everyone wants to display what he or she has ordered in the public.	29				0
Maybe you should add a way for users to bid or counter offer the posted price, because the poster might not be aware of all the potential costs involved	29				0
My hunch is that EMT people in such a situation should have a really simple and fast way to send out the report about current situation in current area.	29				0
Normally, the message notification is under the user section. Maybe you can combine the message to the "Panera Bread(4)", which can help you make the the top bar cleaner.	29				0
Overall, definitely, a very simple and yet powerful application. I can see myself using this ! It would be much cooler to have different features but good job !!	29				0
Since your persona is loking for all new furniture, maybe you can display sample arrangments of rooms and they can see where to find each item within the room.	29				0
The 3 rectangles take up a ton of space on the screen, they can be better consolidated and more effectively provide the user with input if they were nested	29				0
The bar "next Due Date" should be changed to "Due Dates" or something. The term next makes me think there will be one thing when I click on it.	29				0
The interface looks intuitive and easy to navigate. I like the use of increasing the text size for the scores, which indicates its importance to the game and user.	29				0
This application is absolutely something I would use, I am okay with walking a little distance if i know I'm getting the lowest price available and save some money.	29				0
This is really interesting. The pad not only supports laying down, but also supports standing against the wall when not in use. Very smart and efficient use of space	29				0
Who is the interface for? The event planners? Or the people who need rides. If it's for planners, you'd want it to be easy to change passengers and drivers.	29				0
the last storyboard isnt really distinct from the 2nd one snoozing is a fine functionality to present but a better way would be to try explaining it as a need	30				0

way too much text on this storyboard also what is this storyboard trying to convey intimidation in cooking or not knowing how to cook those are two separate user needs	30				0
point awarded because you have the right idea of the point of view but i think you could better apply this to a more specific activity than simply playing games	30				0
i dont think number of pages is an appropriate variable to measure here number of clicks before clicking find missions might be a better measure of what youre looking for	30				0

not sure what the difference is between the content in preparation instructions and the method selected in all meal components i think having real content would have made it clearer	30				0
the video does demonstrate how the app is used but it does not reveal who the potential users are which is why i could not reward you with the point	30				0
after creating a topic bubble and entering the bubble i am unable to add more topic bubbles this only happens when i create the bubble at the top most level	30				0
point of view should be more concise for example your point of view would be fine even after the second the sentence as it captures the main problem of engagement	30				0

About your foot sensor design, I am still doubting whether a normal foot toe movements might cause sending a false signal. But I guess we could just assume it works	30				0
Change "Cancel" to "Cancel my ticket" to maintain consistency. "Cancel" button should have less visual weight since it's a secondary button. You don't want the user to click on that	30				0
For idea 1 interface, it is better to have a desciption section for student's reply. Students can description their works, which helps buyers to choose the best one they like.	30				0
For sleep, food, and exercise, i really like how there is a search function but I would recommend adding filters to each category. It would make the search more efficient.	30				0
I can see the app accidentally being triggered during a workout when the user forgets to say work out. How can the app distinguish between danger and a normal activity	30				0
Is there any reason car info is displayed twice? I think if you only represented it on the right, the space on the left could be used for something else.	30				0
It might be better to specify the detailed scenario of your persona for different scale so that you may have a better idea of what to design in each interface.	30				0
It seems to be cumbersome that the user has to wear sensors to determine posture. Try to find alternative ways to detect motion (video tracking) that don't inconvenience the user.	30				0
It's hard to know where to look first and to know which info is most important. Perhaps utilizing different font weights and text decorations could help with emphasizing relevant information.	30				0
It's limiting to have the info screen only show up when you point the camera at something. Why not just have it show the closest art piece to your location?	30				0
Or even better, to have colorerd background on the watch to indicate good and bad, and have text on it to show what is the suggestion of postures right now.	30				0
Perhaps maybe a simulated picture mode - displaying items in a virtual fridge, with icons indicating how fresh the food is / how urgently the food needs to be eaten	30				0
The heatmap idea is cool, but if the purpose of the design is to find available study rooms then maybe this space could be used to better represent the rooms.	30				0
The recovery view is very useful, a fitness assistant that factors in your ideal rest time and suggests workouts for you based on the ideal muscle groups is very applicable	30				0

there are unique interactions in the app but theyve been poorly explained here and bunched along with those that are either auxiliary or not really unique less is more at times	31				0
the needs are examples of what you can achieve through the outsourcing process itself rather than what users needs are for the mechanism of outsourcing that you will come up with	31				0

i couldnt find the part that reflects on what kinds of things you found heuristic evaluation valuable for and what kinds of things its not very useful for in your experience	31				0
as per the instructions the purpose of that screen to give us an idea of how you expect users to interact with it which is missing hence the point is docked	31				0
i wish the pov focused more on the problem why the subjects ended up failing to track the necessary information about nutritional intake and then its ultimate relation to health complications	31				0
youre still in good shape keep going and it will be a great app dragging the button is somewhat sloppy see if you can use a better maybe even simpler animation	31				0
apart from creatingviewing a workout i dont see any other tasks possible the app should definitely do more talk to me or any other ta about the scope of your app	31				0
some of your needs are too tied to some sort of technology the needs should be very focused on behavior and motivation of language learning rather than the tools they use	31				0
A little confused by the solution and it seems like it may be too general purpose, don't give them the freedom to choose their layout, design the perfect layout for them.	31				0
At the inch scale, It might be hard to distinguish table from table. I could see people with larger fingers having trouble clicking one table over another with such small buttons.	31				0
Because this is a new technique, I wish you can add more details on the interface about the project to allow users to learn more about the project with further information.	31				0
I like the idea, but why not take it further and make an interactive board that the professor can use to add templates or autocomplete what they're writing on the board?	31				0
I think your design uses space a lot better after the in class feedback! I wish there were more colors. You can add colors to buttons or text to differentiate them.	31				0
I'm unsure as to what the "Mark as duplicate" button does. Do you press this when you see symptoms listed twice? Does one then get deleted? How do you decide which?	31				0
Ideally, I believe the public display is like a giant Skype so that trainer and trainee can both see each other's body and trainee can give feedbacks in the real time	31				0
Just a small thing; wouldn't we want to see that accepted is green? And that rejected would be a different color? I'd suggest you work on which colors indicate which priority	31				0
Out of curiosity, how would this be able to support multiple people? If I remember correctly, Melee supports up to 4 players at once; how would you implement this interface then?	31				0
Really like how clean it looks but would recommend not using that shade of blue for everything, it is hard to tell the difference among keys. Would recommend a different color!	31				0
The buttons for music/mode should be larger, especially on the watch interface. I think it would also be itneresting to play with a swipe interface to select either mode or music.	31				0
The design for the schedule is not intuitive. Maybe you could have some symbols or color lump to better visualize the schedule. Show more graph features than words for this section	31				0
The only thing I would add to this is switching the desk to a sitting-standing desk, so that he can continue to work without worrying about his physical posture or comfortability.	31				0
You could utilize a different text color for the friends with the longest snap streaks to make the content more salient. Doing this would also create a logical sense of hierarchy.	31				0

no dead ends per say but links do not open projects filtering does not work and one of the major features of your app uploading a project doesnt seem to do anything	32				0
nicely done however this isnt really possible with a web app so it might be wise to choose another idea or pivot please let me know if you need to discuss this	32				0
what i really liked about this point of view is that you observed different kinds of activities and found a general pov that penetrates the painpoints you found from each of them	32				0
good job overall but there wasnt any description of what kinds of things you found heuristic evaluation valuable for and what kinds of things its not very useful for in your experience	32				0

For me, the content is lacking a bit. I understand it is a simple use case but as such, I would like to see some interesting/unconventional interface instead of simply a tablet.	32				0
For the watch interface, I would recommend not having the list of groceries and instead have a google map/siri telling you where to go to get your items at the grocery store.	32				0
I am bit confused by the "Send Notification" and "Note Participant. They are similar to me. If they are not, maybe you can change the term "note participant" to a clearer name.	32				0
I am not sure how the 3D objects would work with the 2D screen. Is there a way to interact the with the 3D object to project them into the 2d screen_	32				0
I don't know what this number means. Time I've spent in the room? Time left in the room? Where is the interface for selecting which room and for the length of time?	32				0
I don't think there is a need to show all 4 years at once. It should show your current year and let you select other years if you wish to view them.	32				0
I like how simple the inch UI is, but I think that what the user needs to know is whether or not they need to do something. Maybe just stick to reminders?	32				0
I like the blue shades you have but I think it makes some of the text hard to read like shade of blue with "fourth." I would maybe try a different blue.	32				0
I wish the app makes a distinction than adding a function to uber or lyft. For now it does not seem interesting enough.And I'm also confused what does the button setting do?	32				0
I'm curious to see what UI design you come up with - would it integrate using ASCII values to sort lists of users, or some sort of graphical interface to manually group?	32				0
Im concerned with the use of the toes because they are very hard to move individually. Also how will the user know that they sent the right signal? Is there any feedback	32				0
interfaces are nice, but buttons look a little small - especially for the inch interface. Keep in mind most people won't be able to fit 3 fingers on the screen at once	32				0
It would be better to have the public display shows the recommended combo of fitness goals, because it reckon it would be a display on the wall of a gym or somthing.	32				0
It would be nice if the tablet shows your class schedule on the weekly view and the events in that view so you know how each event may fit in your schedule.	32				0
It would be really cool to expand the buttons to allow for pencil gestures to trigger formatting. For example, putting a square around a line of text converts it into a header	32				0
Not sure about the alarm clock UI because it seems like you are showing too much, I would recommend showing the upcoming alarms or have something you can scroll through the alarms.	32				0
On the yard scale, I like how you have the current action showing at the bottom of the screen. It gives a live update of how the user is modifying the system.	32				0
Please explain more in-depth how one would have the glasses start its task - i.e. how the glasses know that he is baking brownies, how the glasses know he needed help, etc	32				0
Probably one thing that is needed by puzzle solver is that they need a way to manage their pieces, since with 1000 pieces it is easy to have some pieces got lost.	32				0
Switching between users should be changed, I don't think people will use or even see the user names so possibly where it says 'Pantry' that could be changed to reflect the user.	32				0
while your p value is indeed 05 it is more better standard practice to report it at its greatest degree of significance which in this case is 01 so your pvalue is p01	33				0

interesting observation of what and how different people maintain some of their past histories it could be a little challenging to come up with a more concrete and unifying core need to tackle	33				0
by adding extremely low level details about how to use the app on the script youre likely going to bias the user and not allow them to explore the app on their own	33				0
i think the kind of comments you received from the other team is valid i also suggest looking into how to build the navigational flow and the main page more informative and intuitive	33				0
think about deadlines so that you are on track each week also mention some stretch goals finally tasks should be more specific and actionable ps please select all relevant pages in the pdf	33				0

the pov is interesting but a little too focused on the solution   college students new grads need a tool to keep track of their networking activities with other connections in different source of communications	34				0
by the way how do you feel about implementing the done button of the tasks view to reflect the chance in the home view ie clicking done removes the upcoming event from the home	34				0
some of the changes you suggested are cosmetic different naming the size of the button etc and i think the focus should have been more on other important questions raised from your heuristic evaluations	34				0
the base activity youre observing is not too clear its great that youre thinking of changing the status quo but this exercise is about finding situations where it may be necessary to begin with	34				0
great job in implementing the overall functionality of the app although im excited for this development i also think that there is some potential for future improvement in both its aesthetics and the user interface	35				0
i think you took detailed notes the subjects response to your interviews however i wish you mentioned in greater detail about the breakdowns and successes that the users faced as that was a bit unclear	35				0
we believe your team deserves extra credit because the app had few bugs and has improved a lot from last week make sure to add some color other than that great job keep it up	35				0
this pov focuses on the solution of having more accurate data instead your pov should focus maybe on the fact that navigation is difficult because the environment is always changing or the confusion in navigating	35				0
it relates to the pov and a storyboard but im not sure what main concept of the app is besides being a way for users to input info about their dog from the prototype alone	35				0
the development plan structure is kinda confusing also it does not lay out who is dedicated to each task it might be easier to organize by assignment and by task rather than by individual days	35				0
sufficient but i also want to see more discussion about how you are fitting in with the brief what changes would you make with respect to that try to incorporate that in the next assignment	35				0
some of your needs are quite insightful but others are more related to improving games rather than the behavior i especially liked the need you stated about having a busy mode in the physical world	35				0
i think the race idea is interesting but try to think outside the realm of timers and task lists those ideas have all been done before planningscheduling apps are on my taboo list for that reason	36				0

this is a decent point of view it combines a comment on people and their lives as well as incorporates motivation for citizen science do more background research into scientific questions that are usually asked in this domain	38				0

some of the needs are dependent on the platforms specific feature types and thinking about having those features or not might bring some insights as to why certain interfaces are designed in their respective ways both bloggers need a way to easily see changes in their follower count and which specific accounts are following or unfollowing them ie other bloggers accounts or business accounts alyssa needs an easier way to sort out pictures to check if her photo will fit in well	38				0

plz remove login credentials collect more data about each spot who you went with what you did why it was enjoyable etc improve visualizations pasting in handdrawn images works make it clearer how the map works if you insist on keeping it as an input mechanism	46				0
this point of view is more a comment on citizen science interfaces themselves what id rather see is something like citizen science can be used to answer this scientific question as well as describing your point of view as to why that question is important to answer	47				0
while i agree that the sample size is smaller than what you would have liked the chisquare test is designed to be more objective for interpreting raw numbers much more so than objective percentages you cant cite percentage differences when you mention that your redesign did better	47				0
because of the struggles of the interviewees the observation writeups were very engaging for the next team assignment if your team decides to keep working on this subject it would be beneficial to analyze other banking apps that serve similar purposes and look for latent design opportunities	47				0
i would actually argue that the button might lead to faster clicks because it is a button and people are able to interact with buttons much easier than a hamburger menu as common as hamburger menus are in mobile apps they actually have pretty poor information scent	47				0
the entire application is centered around ride sharing and the core functionality of the application drivers being able to create rides and riders being able to see potential rides is not working since the main functionality of your application is missing i cannot award you the point	47				0
some observations you made contain valuable insights about the design and how its communicated with the users for example we have to listen carefully to comments like itsic was trying to figure out why the feed was motivating i did not really understand the point of it	47				0
the protocol is well designed and puts a good focus on the interactions of the applications the core functionality of the application still appears to be missing i would encourage your team to focus on that aspect being able to create projects share them before implementing other features	48				0
make sure to actually use the plan and check things off as you go distribute the tasks and not be too specific about the time just ballpark it some tasks are genericvague ex datajson with fake data what data you are faking on which page is not clear	48				0
we expect a complete app in that it satisfies reasonable expectations a typical user will have so that it can easily have at least two screens the scope of this app is exceedingly narrow and the second screen is apparently an extension of the first not a different screen	49				0
what i really liked about this point of view is that it puts commuting in a context ie the beginning of a long stressful day which made me wonder would there be other contexts that commute might well be placed in for example at the end of the day	49				0
great job on the assignment the development plan could be improved by rewording your task names to be more actionable instead of code nutritional facts page put display nutritional facts on the nutrition page when your development plan is updated for a5 reword your tasks to be more actionable	49				0
i think the pov you included contains some of the needs and insights you pulled from your observation but not all for example there were several needs related to user frustration linked to not having an efficient convenient way of gathering relevant travel information but that seems to be neglected	50				0
another note which is optional but encouraged you can improve your development further by adding in constraints will anyone be working on it during thanksgiving is someone busy with midterms or out of town for a weekend this can make your development plan have more realistic time estimations and goals	50				0
to me the most meaningful part of your app is the voting feature that allows users to see and get feedback on their own training habits this is slightly overlooked by the other tasks in your protocol you might want to focus on the core task as the primary function	50				0
great job at needfinding i liked how you went into detail about your observations with each subject and the breakdowns they encountered your list of user needs are all unique and insightful overall i like this idea in how it correlates with the theme of bettering the community at home	50				0
privacy is secondary functionality for now the alert based on gps is not as important as better clarifying your data and your questions about the data good call on the friends feature thats secondary change 5 is really a good example of what you should be focusing on at this stage	51				0
it would be better if i received some sort of confirmation that my eventlocation was successfully shared right now i have to navigate to the recommendations which does not make the most sense there should be some history of my locations recommendations simply implies that those are locations that i might like	52				0
the main page could be a little more visual would how many days are you prepping for be the best question to ask the potential users the firsttime user immediately has to make a choice out of 7 options what would the user be thinking at this point of the apps entry	52				0
however my general feeling on anonymous posting is that it is hard to shepherd the users to contribute positively to the app and other users in some courses the list of comments already is too long and users have to look into each of them to find the most relevant information they want	53				0
some of the needs presented here doesnt directly relate to the breakdowns nor the observations provided for example people need ways to track their past isnt really a need that can be inferred from the observation since they might well be tracking their past ie by uploading pictures or updating statuses on facebook	53				0
i like your idea not only is it creative but it also matches the theme of bettering the community of students who are interested in learning new programming languages i like how detailed your observations were in that you were able to take note of their successes and breakdowns overall great job at needfinding	54				0
good job this week the development plan can be improved it seems to be missing the time estimations for the task and the tasks can be more specific and actionable instead of finalize unique features you can write display user profile information on the user page as an example next week please make these changes	55				0
some of the findings that are listed under not a heuristic could indeed fall under one of the heuristics for example confusing indication of pending requests on home page would fit under match between system and real world because the indication does not match what users have typically come to know as a requests indicator	55				0
im not confident that i understood the idea behind the second storyboard by showing a person who originally got rejected from a company getting an offer from the same company after a year with a screen of a mobile device of different company logos did not give a concrete idea of how this app operates	55				0
please dont reuse links until the previous assignment is graded i tried a few times with incognito but couldnt see the alternative redesign im happy to regrade with a new link as long as you deploy a predeadline commit also unrelated to the grade make sure the links work the first one with www does not	56				0
editing tasks does not work also it is unclear for a firsttime user what exactly the unique purpose of the app is if i were a naive user i would assume that the rewards are real money and i would not get the point that it is supposed to be an app to share among houseroommates	56				0
what is the specific need that youre addressing try to identify the reason why people are frustrated andor why they have to search for a space is availability unpredictable and why or are they not well acquainted with the campus that might help you go beyond a superficial solution or be able to justify it better	56				0
interesting pov personally i would endure extra cognitive and mechanical effort if i could have a good experience overall from cooking not sure if the experience of eating out at a restaurant can be precisely compared to that of cooking on your own but this pov states something that people can relate to which is good	56				0
there are many possibilities of what the app can do or how it can do it than the rather limited scope of coming up with a group what if you dont want to work with someone for whatever reason try making it less focused on a behindthescenes algorithm and more about the interactions that will satisfy the pov	58				0
it would be great if you could infuse some more insights from observing real users into the prototypes you might want to look into user interactions from various angles during the heuristic evaluation sessions this might be crucial to answering questions like why should i use this instead of or along with amazon kindle or goodreads for example	58				0
your needs state a lot of solutions these should only be focused on the users for example instead of your 11th need you could say cashiers need a way to rotate being at the register and performing other duties this need is general enough that multiple solutions could be implemented for it while also capturing the core user need	59				0
itd be cool if you could put some recurrent events as fake data then show the distribution of emotions for each of the occurrences of the event also the graphs are all oversized and dont fit on my screen put in a menubar that i can use to select the different visualizations i would make your app more interactive	59				0
something that might be better to measure is whether users accept a quest more in the original design or the redesign presumably if the redesign is easier to understand then they should be accepting or completing quests more because they are able to understand the purpose from the page instead of trying to figure out how to navigate the page	60				0
theres a slight dead end that i believe could be avoided for now it seems like when you click on comment of the circle and there are no additional comments on it the user just reaches a blank page it might be beneficial to prevent the user from navigating to that page if there are no comments on the circle	60				0
it would be useful to sequence the tasks and deadlines in a useful order next break up tasks into specific not generic such as making sure app reads json data and actionable chunks especially for coding also its fine to simply ballpark time estimates instead of going into precise numbers the whole purpose is that the team uses the plan easily	61				0
good job on mostly finishing the functionality thinking about the cold start problem ie users who have just started using the application might give you some insight about how to restructure some of the interaction flow right now signing up with a new account leads to the same view as trung one extra point was rewarded for implementing interactive graph rendering	61				0
good you get the basics of the brief but your writing is still missing details about how you are pivoting our main idea is to make the analysis of the users personal data useful to user as feedback in other words to help the users fight against procrastination through the data thats not really saying very much what data what analysis	61				0
a3 feedback good job at your he heuristic names should be fully stated controlfreedom to user control and freedom metaphors to match between system and real world i wish the list of he went more in depth explaining exactly why it violated that heuristic as some of were questionable for example how does reliance on submenus for core functions violate aestheticminimalist design	62				0
even though the storyboards do correspond with the pov of allowing the community to voice their problems the main issue seems to revolve around parking so if someone else were to pick up these storyboards they might think that the pov has something to do with solving the issues of parking rather than allowing communities to voice their opinion about all issues	62				0
there might be some design space left to think about how to incentivize users to come back to the platform after they decided their classes some students might be willing to know more detailed information about the structure of the course or how the workload changes over the quarter for example maybe we can gather more information about the quarter mid 3quarter checkpoints	63				0
great job this week development plan seems wellthoughtout however the tasks can be more specific and actionable instead of code homepage write display create task run task settings logout help buttons on the home page not only is this a requirement but it allows the team to know in great detail what should be done so for next weeks update include these changes	63				0
to understand the various situations and interaction between the app and the users creating a reusable prototype like made out of a piece of plywood for example and carrying it around for a length of time a week for example could be helpful i think particularly paying attention to someone who just finished preparing for the weeks worth of meals could be beneficial	63				0
this prototype focuses solely on running but your pov is more general than that are you only doing a running app how does this app differ from other running apps i suggest doing a competitive analysis of other fitness apps to gain inspiration but also to ensure that you dont do something exactly similar this seems very much like the nike running app	63				0
i wish the splash page 1st screen had a slogan of what your application does food for thought can be about anything food related try to narrow it down to the main functionality and explain in a short sentence the goal of your app for example slacks slogan is were on a mission to make your working life simpler more pleasant and more productive	64				0
given that most of your users confusion stemmed from not understanding the training icon as opposed to visiting the dog profile your ab test should probably focus more on that aspect its difficult to measure how many clicks it takes for a user to find something because this could be confounded with a number of factors and is not directly linked to a particular action	65				0
video feedback i enjoyed watching the video and i thought the acting was great especially the ending with hungs extreme satisfaction from watching the video i like how the interface of your prototype was simple one thing i am wondering about is does the app only block websites or does it block other apps too think about how feasible it will be to implement this	65				0
i think theres a little tension between the two questions at stake how would we effectively in terms of what importance of the event record and represent our past vs how can we record our past in a complete manner such that we can always go back and look for the things when we forget we would eventually like to focus on one to the other	66				0
a3 feedback nice he and thorough explanations of your feedback like i said before i wish a comparison was provided between the other teams prototypes to help them understand the advantages and disadvantages of their design going forward think about the possible ways to upload your notes through the video it seems that your notes have to be typed up into the appthat sounds a bit tedious	67				0
also you might want to think about the current flow of the app if its primary purpose is to make people meet other people then why not just have them at least be able to browse and see other people out there in the platform and if they think there are quite a few interesting people then require them to input the mbti type for making matches	67				0
great job observing users and distilling insights from them however this specific rubric item asked to collect and group notes for each observant first before distilling insights because a concrete user scenario which contributes to storytelling and building a persona is often powerful even when in a breakdown scenario here the grouping is somewhat vague and the users identity is washed off but still very detailed and structured observations	69				0
these needs are too focused on the idea of a calendar the calendar is the solution not the need a better way to word these might be students need a way to know all their events for the day at any point notice that there is no mention of the method in which they would use this some of the needs can also be grouped as the same need	69				0
a3 feedback very indepth explanation of your he i like how yall went above and beyond the assignment requirements by providing reflections on your own prototypes images and he worksheets going forward think about how to check if the scientists are providing legitimate research articlesprojects there has been multiple scandals where publication companies do not review articles online resulting in fake information leaking out how will your app avoid this issue	71				0
while i like how you are testing the follow button it may be difficult to obtain any significant results from the exp because people may simply like to press the button if you get what i am saying there is essentially nothing that is preventing them from clicking it again such as a new page change so that is why i am somewhat skeptical of what your results will be like	71				0
some of the needs are weakly related to their respective breakdowns for example in addition he was looking through a powerpoint about punjabi culturehis culture that he was planning to give to a group of students he stated that he is afraid that the younger generation may not be educated enough about their culture and all together take no notice of it is not a breakdown but is used to suggest needs	72				0
its confusing that even though the exercise category doesnt exist possible for novice users the add repetitions button etc still exist at the bottom and do not work thinking about the cold start problem ie users who have just started using the application might give you some insight about how to restructure some of the interaction flow right now signing up with a new account leads to the same view as trung	72				0
some of your needs were focused on improving games rather than improving the human behavior i think youre on the right track with some of your insights for example your need a socially awkward or introverted gamer needs a way to connect with others on a deeper level and games can be a spark to a deeper friendship this need is actually really insightful and could be explored with a design solution	72				0
dont spend too much time on the heart animation you can just put in html pictures for different levels id like to see other visualizations like a line graph of completed acts of kindness by day week month also you should categorize acts of kindness which you can then visualize at an aggregate level for instance donating money vs donating time then you can compare all the tasks youve done under those categories	73				0
overall feedback redesigned page needs improvement the label covers the input text which makes the forum look messy the updown feature to input timedate could be more fluid ie i use the updown button to change the hour but when i want to go to minutes i cant click on minutes to change the time i have to click the right arrow key to move to minutes which isnt ideal through a phone	73				0
i like this idea of allowing students help their peers building a sense of community among them as seen in the video the app helps people find seats what other issues are yall planning to solve perhaps narrow it down to one issue or provide categorization find seatsfind parkinghw helpetc having an app that helps a broad range of issues may lead to an app that is just for chatting about miscellaneous topics	73				0
good start heres a tool that ive made for myself google eisenhower principle httpsgoogl4yuqgt use it as inspiration for the data you are going to collect then think about what visualizations are going to be most important from the data you collect also think about other facets of ones life that contribute to procrastination relationships healthsleep etc what do you think contributes to procrastination the most if you talk to people about it	73				0
i think this prototype doesnt completely connect to the pov as it does not show how its accomplishing the goal of centralizing information the page 4 of the prototype for example is not contributing to the goal any more than what email already does typically a thread of conversation exchanged between an applicant and a recruiter at the company will contain all the information jobview has but an email account typically contains many more	74				0
looking at your wireframes i was unsure about the purpose of the emojis why are some circles bigger than others why are some circles offscreen the organization of the app is difficult to understand what is going on and i am unsure about what i should be doing if you are designing the app to look like the wireframe i would advise that you clean up the wireframe such that it is better organized	74				0
an interesting idea to look at the activity of reading as historical the observation is detailed and how they interact with their reading material is elaborated however quite a few of the pain points reported can be remedied once we converted the reading material digitally therefore the needs presented are mediumdependent which in turn can be thought as interfacedependent if you think of the medium ink on a a sheet of paper as an interface	75				0
and the followings are your need statements the order of presentation isnt consistent with above 1 people need a social timeline platform where they can store all their emotions and easily maybe automatically set visibility to their friends acquaintances and strangers 2 people need a way to store the emotion and get the arty and poetic feeling of handwriting when they are using digital diary 3 people need a way to associate photographs with emotions	75				0
from the pov people become forgetful when they are overwhelmed with too much information at once in a short span of time peoples way to learn should be simplified by reducing interactions as much as possible and also reduce computational complexity from the environment and digital device what is the different between reducing computational complexity from the environment and digital device and peoples way to learn should be simplified by reducing interactions as much as possible	76				0
a note about your overall pov and idea i could see this app being used for fitness purposes in addition to what you intend ie setting a goal location to run to and racing to get there under a certain time thats not necessarily a bad thing but you should either take advantage of that and capitalize on it or flesh out your original idea a bit more so its more clear that its the main purpose of the app	80				0
a3 feedback thorough explanation of your he i like the idea on informing ucsd students about all the food locations on campus going forward think about how this application will cater to both new and old students maps and directions to locations and how to motivate your users to continue using the app offer discounts also ucsd does provide a directory of all the food places on campus and i suggest doing a competitive analysis on their app with your app	81				0
some of the needs are focused on the solution rather than the actual feelings of the users independent of the platforms they use for example both student 1 needs update his habits app everyday to be able to have accurate statistics to show his productivity levels and student 2 needs to be able to physically be able to mark offcrossoff tasks completed right after she has completed them involve a specific type of action update the habit app and interface markoffcrossoff capability	82				0
your observation was very diverse and engaging i believe the statement describes the current challenge of storing selfhistories into the design space correctly i would like you to think about why it is highly distributed what if people like certain aspects of some platforms and therefore choosing to use them without further understanding what drives them to use specific services and platforms it is hard to ultimately convince others to replace or use sidebyside all of them with the service you will provide	83				0
the variables used are not appropriate for a chisquare test because the variables of sessions and views are not categorical meaning they are not mutually exclusive from each other an example of appropriate categorical data would be click or no click on a web page button for the original and variant pages because you cannot both click and not click a button in your calculation you cannot accurately assume how many individual page views were made per session and thus the calculation doesnt fit the test	86				0
the app looks amazing so far despite some dead links a few notes i like how every screen informs where the user is currently user at bills screen says bills etc however be sure to add the name of your app on all your screens there also seems to be three ways for navigation profile helpsettinglogout chatbillschores perhaps combine two menus into one ie profile with helpsettinglogout having more than two menus may confuse your users overall great job cant wait to see your progress next week	87				0
the instructions are thorough but too specific the task should be more general so as to apply more generally to what a user might do with the app in addition the task doesnt capture the unique interaction of the app as this is typical of most budgeting apps some things i think you will need to think about going forward is how to make your app stand out and why the wishlist feature is important or special at the moment the interactions are highly similar to other budgeting apps	89				0
good start your project has the benefit of being very multifaceted and you can go nuts with the type of data you collect i really liked how on fridays youre exhausted tired sad so you used that information to change your schedule come at the data from a more balanced approach placing equal weight to the different facets emotions and productivity seem covered well but what else make sure to drop features that are basically recreating a calendardiary app simplify those so that you can really focus on the interaction with the data	93				0
adding a new add friends feature could be an idea to solve the usability issue involved with requiring users to input the email address ie having to pull out ones phone or laptop lookup the persons contact info try to verify which email address out of 3 that the person youre trying to add has the entire sequence of these actions could be really tedious and overwhelming to firsttime users for example but without thinking through the cause of the painpoint theres a fair chance of complicating your system with the new feature while not solving the usability issue	99				0
good job at needfinding i liked your ideal overall i think it is very creative and i think you noticed a number of breakdowns which proves that this is a common problem among the community of college students some of the user needs were repetitive and i believe you can definitely dive deeper into this issue for example what are the needs of those who arent concerned with dressing up in the morning how does that compare to those who do take the time to check the weather to wear something appropriate does planning outfits play a role in their social life	102				0
great job this week i like where the app is going just make sure to keep nielsens heuristics in mind and include messages that will help the users understand the systems status and diagnose errors the application is also missing some sort of help and documentation login pagesplash page is encouraged to have a summary of what your app does before they enter your app some questions i had can users add classes can users remove themselves from classes what are updates for will viewing the notes show how many likes an dislikes it currently has try to address these questions for user testing	104				0
some of the needs sound redundant to me 1 mudit needs a way with lesser interaction to search the words he doesnt know on his smartphone so that he doesnt waste too much time 2 mudit needs a way to save a word with its meaning directly without copy and pasting it on ms word from the pc 3 mudit needs to track the words and their meanings he searches on his smart phone without going through the browser history 4 christopher needs a way to look for the meaning of the word that would not make him leave reading his article in between	104				0
sufficient but i also want to see more discussion about the brief the calendar seems like secondary functionality focus more on the data and the questions you are asking so far i only see the question how do these events make me feel flesh out more relevant information you would collect with less attention to the events timing information you dont really need a calendar for the timing information just a start and end time and a date sure it makes looking over the weeks events easier but a normal calendar app can do that i suggest rethinking how you want to visualize time for the user	107				0
about the remindthework feature i urge you to observe users in a reallike situation what users actually want could be something very different from what you think is needed for them for instance maybe you will learn that what users are most curious at any given time of scheduling their own workload is to have an answer for the question how am i doing what is the most optimal task to do next given that i have done x y and z recently maybe you might want to design an instant performance review feature or a search recommendation system that lets users search for specific tasks of interest	108				0
the pov is very interesting if we were to provide some sort of visual artifacts that could potentially increase our ability to recall the question is how would we be able to summarize it and make it not cumbersome on an extreme end one could continuously record every second of ones life but does it provide any value then if the video is 24 hours long but if were only given 24 hours a day as well on the other hand if we summarized it and recorded only the important piece of information wouldnt we still be losing stuff since we lose things when we are most unaware of them	110				0
a3 feedback thorough explanation of your hes i think this idea of creating an app that helps keep others in check is interesting its a lot more personal when someone reminds you to do something rather than an alarm going forward think about how to motivate your users to remind each other will they get some type of reward if they complete their tasks on time or when the person is an allstar leader and always reminds people to do their work will they get some type of recognition too also think about the situation of when the all parties of the group forget to remind each other what should happen	111				0
however i found that some needs are not connected to and corroborated by the observations nor the breakdowns reported for example the followings are the parts in your observation that contain the word emotion 1 in weibo she tends to post negative and angry emotions when she is down which she says is because there is less acquaintances in weibo in friend circle on the other hand she always post positive stuff in order to show the best of her to her friends 2 she also uses selfiestick to shoot videos during her traveling because she thinks it is hard to store emotion in photos 3 she concluded that handwriting can stores emotions for her	115				0
i found some of the needs presented are weakly connected to the activity you observed use their computers and visit sitesmediums in which they were viewing news stories andor keeping track of personal information of any sort and the pov bringing in visuals in place of large chunks of small text could potentially stimulate the brain more than just reading through the material word for word and trying to comprehend what each word means santpreet needs a way to better understand stock rises falls and predictions because as a businessfinance major this material is very relevant to him santpreet needs a fun and fresh way to bring more cultural awareness to his community of fellow punjabis	116				0
the app is so cute i like the icons and the splash page the home page and restaurant page have clearcut features some of the pages ex affordability do not have back buttons and the hamburger menu icon doesnt seem to do anything next week please ensure that the menu works and back buttons are added speaking of back buttons the back button on the home page should be removed unless it has an important functionality the home page should be an introductory page for the users so it would be confusing if the user saw a back button they would think they are not on the home page overall i am liking where you guys are going and i cant to see your update next week	127				0
i think the list of changes you made are great but im concerned that the effect of different pieces of changes included in the new version might make the test result harder to analyze for example on the matches page not only each persons profile has been changed from a list view to a grid view but also now there are buttonlooking buttons compared to the original linklooking buttons for chat on the top of the page right under matches it indicates what kind of person youre looking for as well which might also affect the users mental state this is important since this change isnt necessarily following the same logic as with others mainly about how peoples profiles are laid out in the view therefore i recommend you to separate out some of those changes and create different urls that contain individual changes and compare the result	148				0
beautiful and wellfunctioning app i like the unique features you have so far some notes the home button should always be visible your app logo is cute use it as an easy access to the home page the page after you sign in speaking of the home page remove the back button to the login page because the user already logged in they should only be able to return to this page when they signed out i like how the pages are informative about the restaurant and dishes as a user i would be interested in what the dish or the restaurant might look like add images to help your users choose between dishes lastly remember to take into consideration what your peers said to you in class the color palette can be darker the list of items should be in alphabetical order unless filtered the word filter should be visible and make clickable links more buttonlike i think your development plan can be slightly improved by making the tasks more specific overall great job	175				0
good job this week i like where the app is headed and how the tasks from the datajson is related to your app x some notes definitely keep the nielsens heuristic in mind as you move forward such as consistency aesthetic and minimalist design error prevention etc in the menu notifications is denoted as an icon while the other links are denoted by text keep it consistent consistency speaking of the notification icon i am not sure what it was at the beginning it looks really small and ambiguous match between real world and system app seems text heavy aesthetic and minimalist design and as i mentioned in class perhaps cover the description of the task until clicked open still leave the reminder button visible to remove unnecessary text overall i like the unique implementations but make sure they are fully implemented for user testing as mentioned in your assignment a unique interaction is that your app allows you to remind members of your group but your app seems to lack a way to add members to your group is this something you want toshould implement	186				0
a3 feedback beautiful submission so colofrul and thorough explanation of your he i noticed this statement under recognize diagnose and recover from errors these are paper prototypes you cant do this with paper prototypes how is it even possible to answer your question imagine the app had a log in page and i forgot to include my email one popular way to implement a clear error message to help me recognize diagnose and recover from this error is to include a red asterisk on the email field as a way to tell me to correctly fill in this field to include this in a paper prototype you can add another screen that has this error message going forward this idea of providing an organized and easy way for housemates to implement house rules is interesting it perfectly illustrates what the issues are that households may have billing and chores to better your app further try performing a competitive analysis with your app features and existing apps such as your billing feature with venmo another note your app seems to have a lot of features keep in mind the time limit you will have and prioritize which features are more important to implement and which ones should be left to wizard of ozing	212				0
organization of the topics could be made more intuitive and the app itself should be better structured to highlight the main functionality of that page topics and discussions should be separated therefore the home page should only display topics and when you click the topic there you can show all the commentsdiscussions that people are having combining them together on one page can overwhelm your users moving forward make sure to add in more messages to inform your users what they did if user created a topic notify the user that they created a new topic this will ensure that the visibility of the system is clear to the user heuristic make sure that each screen has the name of your app as well as the name of the current page that the user is on keep the back buttons consistent some back buttons have labels while others dont another heuristic speaking of back buttons what is the purpose of the back button on the home page the user should not think that they are not in the home page and a back button can be confusing unless it serves a reasonable purpose i would remove the back button on the home page over all good job cant wait to see your progress next week	215				0
good job this week i think the app has potential as the unique features mentioned in your assignment sound really cool and i believe that are something your users are interested in some tips on how to brush up your app i think these unique features should be more visible as a scientist i want to upload projects instead of allowing users to easily upload a project they must view my projects to upload a project even though this page should have an upload button i noticed that i was having difficulty figuring out that i had to go that page first to upload a project perhaps have a readily button that allows me to upload project in one click moving forward make sure that your unique functions are completely implemented or done through wizard of oz also make sure that the buttons are doing what they expect to do i noticed that when i try to click the logo which should take me back to home page the article on the homepage which should show me the whole article and the pagination at the bottom of the home page does not seem to be fully implemented i also noticed that the user account has a lot of edit options perhaps have a universal edit option to make the profile page less cluttered nielsens heuristics minimalist design	227				0

datatemplates currently only persistent changed node session data is on vote counts as noted from things above missing a lot in other areas	23	1	0	0	1
i like the timer functionality but it seems a bit redundant and confusing to have both a percentage scale and a timer because you focus on the timing of brushing i suggest keeping the timer clock instead maybe make it clear from the main game page that the teeth youre collecting is for your animal right now its only clear if you click the help button some of the buttons cut off in mobile form and sometimes the images dont load correctly	82	1	1	1	3
great functionality so far its unclear what it means to fight a boss though some of the functionality in friends needs to be fleshed out as well	27	1	1	1	3
i think perhaps a gallery view might be interesting to try rather than a single image slideshow it could also be made clear that there are multiple images the user can look through as at first glance it seems theres only one image per post	45	1	1	1	3
a few goals were missed	5	0	0	0	0
the navigation is still a little convoluted there are a few too many levels to go down and sometimes its hard to recover back to a previous screen such as the upcoming eventsback to group details the top banner doesnt need to take up that much space	47	1	1	1	3
great job improving on the home page a couple things it would be nice to be able to challenge friends directly from the challenges tab when refreshing the profile page the potato skin reverts to the default	37	1	1	1	3
in general looks like your app is pretty far along i would work on some of the things mentioned above i think priority would be getting the votes to work and then maybe being able to see my own posts	40	1	1	1	3
data submitting things like posts and comments work well for server persistence but the voting isnt quite there i would look into post requests for that	26	1	1	1	3
would be nice to have a way to see just my own posts	13	1	1	1	3
can i log out	4	0	0	0	0
notes  even some simple form validation like the required attribute for user input would be handy	16	1	1	1	3
the home page still needs some work in terms of the mental model it would seem as though the user can click on the images below may be better to just have level progress bars without the images there also isnt a clear connection between achievements and how that relates to the pet there should also be a way to prevent users from unlocking irrelevant achievements rather than just being able to click on any of them	77	1	1	1	3
double click sometimes doesnt work how do i delete systems	10	1	1	0	2
very well organized dev plan but i could not figure out how to complete the task asked of me ie run around a few buildings i only seemed to be able to run around cog sci also the activity and rankings page dont seem to update based on my activity which seems to be core functionality	56	1	1	1	3
comments great storyboards your app reminded me of charity navigator httpwwwcharitynavigatororg one thing to consider is the different attitudes people may have towards donating to charity some people might want to donate a small amount regular others to build up to a larger goal over time if they're not able to access a charity they want to donate to through your app they might also be inclined to give up can they set monetary goals for particular charities is money their only interaction with these charities or at least the only one that you want to support all good questions to consider second idea is simple but i like it would have liked to see a particular example of a daily challenge is there a possibility of doing something nice for another user win the app gives an incentive to the person being challenged to participate and to continue coming to the app	153	1	1	1	3

he changes interesting dialogue approach with the he evaluations fun to read might be useful later to condense this into a concise list just so its easier to keep track of for changes in the future	36	1	1	1	3
revisiting the brief is good incorporation of the 5stage model but missing more detail about actual changes the second paragraph helped with that a good amount though still more concrete changes need to be identified and made	37	1	1	1	3
functionality still a couple bugs and perhaps not quite completely ready for testing once you get all this api madness finalized would ideally like to see some other tier of functionality involved in the application i think what would really encourage some additional exchange to happen would be what i noted above about being able to see who has checked in when like a nice aggregate of all this information with your list viewrandom or something that way i might be interested in chatting up someone who had been somewhere recently and getting their opinions something like that would be nice  some concrete data that people would actually be pretty interested to see	113	1	1	1	3

home page nice start to your home screen some things to consider once a user is either renting something out searching for things looking to rent etc should their home portal show different things rather is choosing between renting out things and renting from others going to most likely be the page someone wants to see by default this can all depend a lot on how users behave maybe most people will only either be mainly a buyer or mainly a renter maybe most people will live in both realms probably not hugely important but something to think about if you want to ensure that first page contains the best value for users	113	1	1	1	3
home page good start make sure you start considering a number of the heuristics covered in the last assignment at first glance its hard to determine what exactly i should be doing at a user if its a button make sure its obvious its a button if i hadnt already been brief with the prototypes from previous assignments i wouldnt have noticed that the two bottom boxes are the main functional buttons recognition over recall will be a big one for this screen	83	1	1	1	3
group he solid distilling of major errors solutions are pretty generic though perhaps some deeper discussion on solutions that would really fit well into the overall design of the prototypes could be more useful to address the ending note i agree that he can often draw away from the evaluation of the idea of an application needspov etc he mostly concerns usability but it is true that at this level of prototyping a little more consideration  given to the idea would be very valuable if we had more time in the course we would definitely love to fit in some more needsidea evaluation	103	1	1	1	3
missing some feedback that compares the two prototypes beyond just nothing that both are missing the same thing	18	1	0	0	1

how is the distribution of hours going seems a bit uneven  can you add a total actual hours for each person to your spreadsheet  the time that your group meets	30	1	1	0	2
be careful about creating something like tinder for ucsd as this has been done over and over again your pov included social anxiety and i think your storyboards and prototypes should more address the social anxiety aspect rather than simply being an app to find connections or friends think of some other game elements that you might be able to incorporate into a social app like this	67	1	1	1	3
overall i think the idea of provoking honest feedbackcriticism between people is a great design problem would love to see how this turns out and how you can make it work the specific market of fashion critique is a great place to start appearances are probably something that people think about all the time	54	1	1	1	3
storyboard 2 for storyboards you really want to focus on the users experience when using your potential solution its not quite clear in storyboard 2 how the engagement of the application affects your user there seems to be a lot more heavily focused on the problem there should be a good balance	52	1	1	1	3
pov good articulation of strategy and issue of honest communication can we condense this a little bit more think about if you had only 1015 seconds to pitch your pov to someone what would you say this will be useful to know moving forward	44	1	1	1	3
inspirations needs more insightful explanation on why these choices are inspirations this section is not just a list of other products and what features they have the tinder bullet might be the closest to addressing this but still lacks depth in what about this particular matchmaking system inspires you or offers some insightful takeaway	54	1	1	1	3

inspiration a lot of fantastic discussion on particular interface features and interactive elements would like to see some more commentary on some higher level inspiration related to your pov on your own time spend a few thinking about some other applicationssystems that might inspire you in that area	48	1	1	1	3
pov the core user need can be clearer in this point of view just learning described as a daunting task nor pointing out the potential useful need of peer experts is quite concretely demonstrating a user need	37	1	1	1	3

well done great job finding a diverse set of participants with meetings involving members with varying levels of commitment a core problem with many different possible breakdowns	27	1	0	1	2
fantastic job with the organization of your assignment most of the breakdowns you observed seemed to revolve around reminders which does make sense i would have been interesting to see if there are any parts of the whole exchange that could yield interesting insights for example even the decision stage at a restaurant table when people try to organize payments could be interesting in a longer span it could also be interesting to see how much people pay each other back in a mutual fashion would we really need to exchange money all the time if were always paying for each other of course not possible with the time scope of this assignment but something interesting to think about	119	1	1	1	3

in general everything is mostly functional  nice work there only small kink at the moment still is being able to have multiple users testing the app at once  i think you really want to focus on interaction flow now think about all the cases where users will want to do things	51	1	1	1	3
home screen the goal list is off center from the buttons when your homescreen is viewed on the desktop when viewed on a mobile device the logout button overlaps the with your logo and the lower three buttons become stacked remember that youre developing a mobile web app your home screen should be developed accordingly	55	1	1	1	3

severity is having a help page really severity level 4 this was the only level 4 you listed  but i would say a lot of the usability issues you mentioned are much more important and not having a standalone help page isnt probably catastrophic to app functionality	47	1	1	1	3

home page good start one thing to consider moving forward is what users would like to see on their first functional home page would they prefer a list of all colleges when you provide a search anyway or perhaps a list of the colleges they are currently followingmost interested in its also not quite obvious what the difference between your home selection and schools selection is at the current point in time in general if you decide to have users create their own personalized list youll want to distinguish between your schools and schools overall	95	1	1	1	3

pov i think this pov is getting close but could be honed down a little closer to the concrete need addressed particularly in responding to the impersonaldegrading aspect of asking for favors what do users actually need for this to not be a problem just a provided hub for this may not be enough to clarify this design space there are many hubs and possibilities for hubs what is your point of view on what needs to exist in this space	81	1	1	1	3

good job i really like the metaphor of the timer in the first prototype	14	1	0	0	1
prototypes for the scans you should show some steps indicating a flow that takes a user through the application otherwise someone looking would not be able to distill the proper interactions from the prototype and create a functional application	39	1	1	1	3
in general its also a little difficult to distill the critical highlevel design differences between the two prototypes they both seem pretty centered around a lookup of people teaching certain subjects and the ability to initiate some conversation considering some different designs to address your pov can greatly help with the iterative process try to spend some time thinking about on your own time this will also help you figure out exactly what core feature makes your final app what it is	82	1	1	1	3

pov not clear where the core user need is in this pov that points toward the design space looking for different food  snack options is a very broad area as is giving information  opportunities to find better meal options what is it in particular in your point of view that you think students need to successfully engage in the exchange of food	62				0

photo 1 michelle no clear demonstration of breakdownsopportunites	8				0
needs  a number of redundancies in the list ex needing to be able to utilize colloquial phrases better	18				0
needs some of these needs were redundant and could have been squashed down into fewer one of the things to watch out for mostly because of the nature of what you observed is to not fall too deep into generating too many needs that are interface specific remember to take a step back and think about the activity as a whole the users experience their core motivations and ultimately what they need and how that can be the basis for some interesting design projects	84				0
very interesting choice of topic and great diversity in activities chosen i found that the most insightful observations that you made were in your 3rd section with the natural interative setting between leo  mikey where you brought up the design opportunity that learning together is fun i would have liked to see more of this type of oberservation in your other sections often times its whats done that can speak even louder than what is said	76				0
very interesting discussion of habit being an inhibitor to novelty also interesting was the perspective of work interrupting entertainment rather than the more common version of entertainment distracting from work	30				0
needs some redundancy in needs ex efficient discovery of appealing content	11				0
be careful not to focus on the solution too much the first photo provided was more solution focused than demonstrating a breakdown some of the needs listed were also more featurefocused also in your observations rather than noting how theyre parking think about how parallel parking is affecting them ie were they stressed were they afraid etc	57				0
your pictures did not make the breakdowndesign opportunity clear your needs were written as things that the user wants not needs also they were often written as  features  eg user wants a confirm alert where you should be talking about the underlying need that a confirm alert is trying to address why does the user want a confirm alert the need there is to avoid making an error	68				0
two of your breakdowns were very general  they sounded more like a restatement of the challenges of dieting than an example of exactly how a diet goes off course	29				0
the only point you lost was for not clearly demonstrating design opportunitiesbreakdowns in your submission your interviews were written up describing what the people you interviewed said without focusing on the actions they took and your own evaluation of the content of their statements its important when doing needfinding to go deeper into what people do by digging deeper into the answers that people give you in addition to listening	70				0
ensure that you are not articulating user needs as solutions or features  that the photo captions also express breakdowns	19				0
hoa i added the point that we talked about	9				0
missing photossketches for each observation observations should be more comprehensive and demonstrate a clear user breakdown and should be explicitly linked to the studio brief needs were more solutionfocused rather than userfocused this assignment is more about understanding the user and what the user might need rather than the app they might use did not dock points for presenting in studio since you entered the class after this assignment was due	71				0
the topic and ideas are great be careful not to become too invovled during observations you want to observe as if youre an outsider	24				0
the topic is interesting but needs to be more explicitly related to the studio brief also only 2 participants were observed	21				0
since you chose different types of users to observe a comparison or commonality of breakdowns between them wouldve been exciting to point out	23				0
i am one of those people that uses a dslr while carrying many lenses if you want to see a particular setup that has worked for me and the design thoughts that went into it let me know and i can share it during office hours	46				0

observations commentary here could be more clear on what breakdownsdesign opportunities you found while observing activities you mention a lot of he saidshe said but not much of really detailing particular things that actually happened while you were watching it can help a lot in these cases to be more specific as you watched person x perform activity y z happened when they tried to achieve abc etc	68				0
great work a couple of your needs are more features than needs other than that great	16				0
as we discussed this is a very important and serious topic that being said ensure that you are able to fully complete the learning goals of the course within the prope scope  eg these observations are based on your interviewees observations where the assignment specifically wanted you to conduct the observations if the grandiose nature of this topic means you will not be able to fully complete the learning goals i would strive to find ways of scaling down the topic or finding communities in your immediate environment eg refugees coming toin san diego in order to ensure you are reaching the learning goals in this course questions come to office hours	112				0
some of the violations and compartive analyses listed could have been explained in greater detail good job overall	18				0
ensure following directions  submitting in pdf format	7				0
the other category shouldnt exist  these should be categorized within the heuristics for example  there is no progress report at the end of 21 days which summarizes the completion number of missed days continuity streak for each activity 3  this would be considered flexibility and efficiency of use a regular user of this app would expect some sort of reportingstatus update and this is not a use case supported in the current prototype	73				0

appreciated your use of a table for formatting	8				0

very nicely done so far i like the concept of heroes and villains and working together to earn points i think the homepage could still use some work with understanding how the powerupp button works maybe having it faded out until the user selects a work out will make it more clear when and why they should press it	59				0

you guys have done a lot of great work on this app i had to take a point off for the polish and ready to present im sure youre focusing on it for the final presentations but it does make a big difference that the calendar isnt working i also know its very close to the deadline but you might consider for demo purposes wizard of ozing the typical interaction for receiving an event after setting up so instead of taking until 10 pm have a wait time of 10 seconds and then display the event on the recent page	100				0
great work this week one issue i didnt see described in the list of revisions is the fact that the  piggy closet page is not connected to any other page the hamburger menu doesnt link back to the main screen the one thing that would add the final bit of polish would be to give some sort of indication on the dashboard as to how many piggy points i have how long until i accrue more etc being reminded of the piggy points increases the motivation to actually interact w the piggy 1 point off because the closet screen not being completely connected is a polish issue and ought to be fixed before the demo	115				0
overall awesome progress super cool seeing people who have been to the places not only in the random roll but also when clicking on a marker in the map nice work list view and individual view could still be polished up a bit in terms of style but its looking pretty demoable to me	54				0
missing github link	3				0
great job on the functionality and i look forward to hearing your pitch	13				0
i feel that you should also test for the core functionality of the  app ie the trading card part or the reroll part as these are essential for your app some other possible revisions for different portions of your ui should also be addressed you may also want to think about how the chore cards should be displayed rather than scrolling through 10 chores	64				0
appreciate the humor but use that effort for going deeper good job regardless	13				0
well done just missing video questions	6				0
2 deductions   your development plans dont have weeks 58 or week 10 ive been pretty lax on grading these but i have to take a point off for this	29				0
i would recommend for the demo on friday to focus on having navigation working properly it looks like in the version im looking at now theres something janky going on w sessions possibly due to facebook login but i keep getting redirected to the login screen i would also avoid saying  your system isnt under maintenance too honest instead youre offering me the convenience of signing in w facebook yay   itd be a good idea have 1 wizard of ozed sequence of screens for demo purposes	86				0

deductions	1				0
comments really liked your inspiration board your prototype was really well thought out but at times especially the first one was very busy for the second prototype you might want to consider not sending regular summary notifications to users and not asking them initially how often they want to be contacted because that������������s not something they will necessarily know right off the bat another thing to consider is how you can make the gamification aspect of your app intuitive but not timeconsuming if you������������ve  seen the app neko atsume you see that it������������s a game that doesn������������t require that users spend a lot of time using it but that has managed to get people to keep coming back this is a balance that you could try to strike with the piggy game dressing up the pig is a cute idea maybe other activities than simply saving money can accrue rewards	150				0
comments your approach feels very generic you might run into the risk of trying to solve too many problems at once and not really doing any one thing well focus on narrowing down your point of viewtry thinking back to personas see scott������������s videos from week 2 and developing one or two example users for your app  i like the idea for the second app because it������������s more clearly intended for a shy person who wants to make friends but needs a way to overcome their shyness	87				0
storyboard 1 i should be able to make a distinct prototype from the one your team made based off of this storyboard but it already includes a view of the specific interface	32				0
inspiration didnt make abstractmetaphorical connections to point of view	9				0
deductions  point of view doesnt specifically engage the brief	9				0
comments second prototype was very difficult to read also seems to be made for a desktop view not a mobile web app i like your idea of specifically helping cs students develop their portfolios i think it������������s time to do more needfinding have you talked to people who are actively working on projects i think the second idea has a lot of potential but right now is confusing and not quite clear is this a portal for tracking work for applying to jobs for viewing others websites	87				0
prototype is lacking in final polish	6				0
rather than focusing on studying is boring perhaps think of why traditional studying is ineffective and why students struggle with it inspiration board should include more screenshots to make a more direct link between that inspiration and your prototype in your storyboards you also include the teacher which is not stated in your pov and was difficult to follow the sequencing many groups have made study apps in the past so think about how you might mae yours more innovative and outofthebox than simply a study app	87				0
overall i think youre on track however id encourage you to articulate a clearer pov that is more closely tied to the issues your raise with exploration or being in a certain place at a certain time note that these are two different needs and you should select one of them to focus on	54				0
observations very important insight found about the keyboard blocking normal interaction flow that you wouldnt normally be a problem on a desktop great detail overall	25				0
dont overlook the difficulty people may have with writing down their appliances watt usage this may be a point where people get frustrated and leave your app also was looking for a clearer description of your ab testing including metrics and potential outcomes	43				0
inspiration not very inspiring good enough idea but im not seeing much creativity	13				0
in the second prototype the idea of ratinglisting by menu items rather than general eateries is great its definitely another angle to take that has a huge effect on the experience of exchanging information about food perhaps theres a way to kill two birds with one stone here finding where to eat and what to eat in one motion	59				0
storyboard 2s doesnt directly lead to a prototype	8				0
inspirations should demonstrate critical thinking by explaining how those articlesapps fall short or what other questions they lead to	19				0
good work overall most of my pertinent feedback was given during studio  in office hours	15				0
the novelly idea is fun to think about i would think about talking with potential users more especially users who are writers and see how they might react to such a situation	32				0
i really liked your prototypes and storyboards great job at putting a unique twist on traditional productivity apps	18				0
main takeaway would be to focus on distilling one key feature that makes your app what it is this will help tremendously in moving forward with the design process	29				0
clear but the scope of social collaboration can be broadened a bit rather than just only within games	18				0
your observations were of college students but your needs mentioned young kids make sure your needs address the population you observed some needs were slightly redundant your sketches and captions better described the breakdowns than your description of the observations	40				0

observations could be a little bit more clear on where breakdownsopportunities are occurring in some of your observations ex are there instances where brian slips while going about the normal routine of correcting differences did any mishaps happen when trying to recall routine fro memory	45				0
good choices of activities to observe regarding student organizations particularly interesting how much memory is involved in activities 1  2 from counting votes to teaching routines taking care of memory issues is always an opportunity for design in technology	39				0
photo  3 could have more clarity on the breakdown is it just lack of knowledge where does this user slip has he shown indication of trying to find other musicians which part of that along the way give slight to this breakdown	42				0
nice work  it could also be interesting to interview someone on the other side of the event planning equation eg an event goer  what is their threshold for attending an event	31				0

very thorough great job	4				0
observations could be more clear on where exactly the breakdownsdesign opportunities are asking whether or not they would be willing to exchange for food recipes and cooking lessons is a leading question and does necessarily give reliable insight on opportunities for design	42				0
needs a number of redundancies needs that arent particularly critical enough to warrant a design project we want to really think about what was observed and what motivations would drive peoples actions in the activity you observed	37				0
photo 2 does not have a clear breakdowndesign opportunity just describes how dan goes about his routine	17				0
cool logo everything themes pretty well and gives off the right feeling for what kind of people this app caters to	21				0
test results surprising results are always fun though this is not to say at this moment we are able to really claim one is comprehensively better over the other somewhere down the line there may be other content youd want to fit in an upper header which would necessitate moving category navigation into the side menu etc it was good that your team had a fallback to user feedback for making design decisions in this project scope	77				0
test results nice process  organization good to see that with more tests you were able to come to a more confident result also great touch with keeping track of additional variables for back your findings	35				0
list of changes good list very useful to have context for the changes listed alongside the actual proposed change	19				0
i cant gleam the features that novelly will have from your home screen	13				0
good job overall new navigation between question tabs seems to work really well will there be any plans to actually allow someone to make an account and login would be nice to be able to actually mess around with questions that users generate  currently it wont let me create an account and persistently says password fields do not match	59				0
home screen very well developed remember youre designing a mobile web app so you should be optimizing for that view when i view your home screen as a mobile app the piggy jr view has overlapping buttons and is unclear also you have two tiers of toplevel navigation which takes up a lot of screen real estate in the mobile view how many of those buttons do users actually need immediate access to try looking into additionalalternative ways to do navigation	81				0
individual he fantastic analysis of usability well organized with useful comparisons drawn between the different prototypes very easy to read well done	22				0
group he good flow from highlevel issues down to very specific usability issues potential solutions offered are reasonable providing specific examples in the prototypes of broader reaching usability errors is very useful especially for the team who was evaluated	39				0
home page good start something to consider based on your current page theres a lot of space left an example not necessarily what you should do is it necessary to take an extra step to jump to a list of clubs for example you might just simply start listing clubs with the hero action to start matching up at a location thats always visible bring this up in a team discussion of what exactly you would like your user to see as a default maybe always having to choose between two options by default is a hassle and you can replace that space with something more useful	107				0
i liked that the feedback was placed side by side  very useful	12				0

a smarter and more relevant search with fewer questions only city and date will be implemented  the purpose of an ab test is to work past what we think is intuitive or smarter as discussed in class these inclinations are often wrong	42				0
app looks in good shape and you scoped your ab test well to answer a basic but meaningful question only points not given were for not updating the dev plan to say more specifically what you will do this week a lot of steps go into making a good poster and you did not put in your dev plan what changes you would make based on your ab test	69				0

in this iteration it seemed that the cookies functionality wasnt working the pets also dont seem to animate on the home page they were so cute the pictures in the gallery also didnt load correctly when i tested on my phone and in device mode on chrome otherwise great job so far i think your concept is very cute and creative looking forward to your presentation	66				0
good work so far on your visual design and functionality looking forward to your presentation	15				0
notes original design url and redesign url are submitted the redesign is functional  redesign is not fully functional  ensure this is before you complete used testing 1 when click refine user previous search queries are not carried over so as is its currently just starting a new search 2 filter doesnt actually filter based on inputted queries	57				0

great work on the ec assignments the only thing is the video could have been more appealing by walking through a scenario in which a user would use the app in real life rather than walking through its features	39				0
the photos show and the captions thoroughly describe clear breakdowns or opportunities  some of the user breakdowns were due to a lack of functionality not a violation of neilsens heuristics etc	31				0
video was very entertaining glad to see arvind learned how to properly slice vegetables haha	15				0
great job on the ec assignments only thing missing was evidence of users using the app would be nice to include a google analytics page of usage or of the database of users	33				0

great work  specifically the user interviews observations insights gathered	9				0
really push these next couple weeks looking forward to seeing how things shape up	14				0
app things in the next week really focus on bringing out whatever key features you believe to make your app what it is soon youll be testing that out with real live users a wonderful task as a user with wizard of ozed data to complete would be filling out a profile with interests playing with the match making system finding out some awesome info and having the org information ready to go from that point forward you have that basic flow existing already but now is the time to get it all feeling as real as possible think about what a user will want to do after each of those steps  can you provide for that i think the signup and interest filling out is pretty straight forward maybe for the purpose of mocked functionality you want to just let users pick interests from a list that is built from interests associated with the orgs using the app then from that pull together a list of potential matches to put the user through make sure the matching page feels a little more comfortable with what exactly users are supposed to do after the matching make sure the user has somewhere to go to review their new findings with what awesome orgs they should get involved with this doesnt have to exactly be the outline of how you should plan things from here but its an example of how i might think about the key parts of each step  at each step does the user know what to do and what the next step should be after completion if this all sounds way too vague feel free to contact me whenever	281				0
development plan good work really liking the detail on each of the task items would be useful to detail some tasks you will be using for your consistency check in week 7 i think its a great idea to have a list of basic tasks just like the one in this assignment to try to run through your app to gain an overall feel working out as many kinks before we dive into testing as you can would be awesome	80				0
deducted single point for not meeting the following criteria	9				0

interaction flow good progress navigation is definitely improved i think the one area of confusion still with navigating is that the two main viewing tabs would likely be my questions and all questions i would suggest having that on the bottom bar along with your home button it doesnt make much sense to have to click into the menu and then to all questions to view all questions additionally i think in general it may be a better idea to show all questions as the default and have be my questions to be where you can tab to as a secondary track your stuff function that way when users first enter the app regardless of what they sign on to do they are immediately exposed to questions that they can possibly answer  you want people to answer stuff	138				0
interaction flow everything is connected up pretty well but i think flow can still be improved for navigation in general you can consider some other options tabsmenu etc to restructure how a user moves through all the main pages although i wouldnt prioritize this because what you have works out alright with the home page having buttons to path deeper  the place where someone might feel the most lost is when they get to match me up there still isnt much indication of how long a user is supposed to stay in the matching phase and what they ought to be doing  should i keep matching until theres no more until i find one i like until i find 3 i like what should i do after the match me up phase etc	133				0
comments for the pov you������������re telling me that sleep schedules contribute to healthy lifestyles you can reframe this by saying �������������people need a to maintain their sleep schedules������������� even better would be if instead of talking about people you had a specific target usergroup in mind also you������������re already bringing in the specific solution scaring your users that you will use to address your need that is what the storyboard is for not the point of view solid inspirations	79				0
deductions  pov specifies a clear need but doesn������������t tell me how it relates back to the studio brief just needed one more sentence linking it back	26				0
inspirations were all directly related to cooking didnt go beyond that context to make more abstract connections	17				0
paper prototype 1 unclear navigational flow	6				0
prototypes dont contain enough detail how do i navigate the fridge prototype can i click on items inside of the fridge no update goal screen from prototype view	28				0
comments great inspiration board your point of view talks about health related goals but isnt specific to something a user needs to be able to do also it already includes a solution which it shouldnt do try thinking back to personas see scotts videos from week 2 and developing one or two example users for your app	57				0
deductions  user need is prescriptive not usercentered	7				0
inspirations showed apps that currently seem to solve the problem without explaining why they fall short if the problem is already solved by someone else why do we need your app	31				0
competitive analysis good distinction from yelp but im not sure they are the best fit for covering similar solutions in the same market your app is based on utilizing media to explore where other people have explored for yelp thats a very secondary at best function can you find any other apps that focus on the idea of friend checkins	60				0
interaction flow find explorers page primary functionality not quite clear and usable at the moment	15				0
data its a start for data usage but as of turnin pretty sparse usage could you have better mocked up the find explorers page with some json data	28				0
dev plan the creep block items probably could have been budged better toward finishing the primary functionality of all pages namely find explorers	23				0
comments well done on 2nd storyboard 1st prototype������������s navigational flow was unclear like the idea for the second prototype is there a way to invite friends through the app via sms email etc seems like a crucial feature being able to find an event by name or organizer or something other than location seems like another important option to include	60				0
deductions  pov doesnt articulate a clear user need without also including a proposed solution	14				0
supporting info haha nice self destructing task message	8				0
functionality is great so far really like the concept and animations only thing is data doesnt seem to be handled asynchrounously through get or post	25				0
i cannot tell if the multiplayer is actually working yet i think it would be essential to see that actually functional before we can test the interaction and how testers feel about hte app	34				0
good job fill in more of the data so that the testers can see more examples of what the site might look like	23				0

the functionality of submitting a photo is still not fully functional but the idea of submitting and liking others photos is neat very cute visual design the one thing was a bother was that every time i visited the home page the tutorial pop up would show up which can be redundant and annoying for users who have already gone through the tutorial data doesnt seem to be handled through get or post to be asynchronous it also isnt super clear from the home page that the main functionality is to submit pictures	93				0

great work bringing in inspirations not directly related to eating eg spotify	12				0
this shopping list idea is taboo i will need to see it become more divergent and unique how can personal informatics really enhance the utility of the app where are you using personal informatics in your prototypes and storyboards	39				0
the point of view could be more explicit but its still good its just that the point of view is strongly implied the motivational posters are a little too disconnect and obvious the prototypes are detailed but you would benefit from simplifying even further if you can as for the relation to the brief it does fit with it but could you look for a more nuanced relationship or deeper meaning between mood and productivity	75				0
since most people are indecisive  this claim lacks evidence	9				0
very well done very clear and easy to follow your thought process i had some difficulty differentiating your prototypes and also wanted to see how you thought current tools for this problem fall short but i think youre on the right track and with a solid pov you have plenty of material to guide your iterations	56				0
it is not clear how your pov engages with the studio brief or where current solutions fall short why does searching tip websites not work and how will your app help address that issue also  a little more detail on how your prototype flows would be helpful	47				0
look for deeper and more abstract connections for the pov make sure you decide on the specific audiencecommunity that follows your pov	22				0
careful getting too specific on a solution in your pov also as i said in class your storyboards should have a clear situation with a user need and a story of satisfying it  i like your pov and inspirations but think a little more critically about the issues of selftracking productivity	51				0
but your photos 1 and 2 were of solutions not of the observation breakdown or design opportunities	17				0
great diverse set of observations for this activity would have also been interesting to see how the rest of the exchange process goes rather than the beginning but i understand the constraints of time be careful about restricting insight to much to specific systems like tritontexty can we generalize things a bit more based on what you observed what general breaks down for online transactions and what needs can come based on that theres a lot of opportunities for different angles here	82				0
good job i like how you observed a diverse set of people who use emoji as well as create emoji	20				0

some of your needs are much too feature oriented as opposed to a need that presents a design opportunity	19				0
the explanation of how each music affected the participants in your observations was great	14				0
i was confused as to what you were observing the observations did not demonstrate breakdowns that could serve as  design opportunities within the scope of this project some of the needs listed were focused on technologies rather than user needs remember that the studio brief is games with a purpose meaning you should be looking or behaviors or activities that could be improved through game design and game elements ie studying exercising socializing etc	74				0

needs a few of these needs arent as relevant to the activity you observed	14				0
needs some redundancies	3				0
observations remember that you are trying to observe exchange in social situations some of your observation discussions dont seem to relate that much to that activity for example the breakdown with colin doesnt really show any slips with him exchanging during his social lunches only that he eats with the same friends a better breakdown for example might be that colin fails to talk about interesting topics because he eats with the same people every week	76				0
observations would like to see a lot more insightful commentary on the breakdownsdesign opportunities for each your observations it seemed like the main issue you brought up was that they had to use pictures of schedules to sync up in that activity where were the pitfalls what doesnt work about this method what does work	55				0
photo 1 similar to above its not clear where the breakdowndesign opportunity is in this photocaption having to default to using your phone to engage in the activity is not so much of a breakdown where exactly was the pitfall of this interaction	43				0

he changes good work might be useful to condense all of these changes into a super concise list for ease of reference as you progress through development in the next few weeks	32				0
revisit missing discussion of concrete changes over time with design tools learned thus far i like the leveraging of already made networks to gain more catered reviewsindicators of where to go	31				0
plan would like to see a little bit more specificity in tasks focus on having things that are immediately actionable for example use he to make changes to hs adp and log is a pretty big task assigned to the entire group that requires a pretty big overhead in deciding who at what moment does what in particular   i would move the stretch goes into separate feature tasks so they are easier to keep track of and more modular in terms of who to assign to and what to do etc missing time estimates makes it hard to account for potential scheduling obstacles	103				0
he changes very thorough listing of he violations and changes to address them also nice organization with categorizing which changes youve already done and which are in progress not sure where make the login page the first page is occurring might have been an outdated change	46				0
revisit good discussion here about how you iterated from initial idea conception making the group experience fun and having a final judge can definitely be useful for facilitating exchange one thing youll definitely have to consider is the cost of employing this final judge especially if you are a wishy washy rascal that doesnt care to take part in deciding youll want to lower this cost as much as possible one way to go about this is to take advantage of repetition people with this problem may or may not up to you to find outdecide on this go out and eat often how can we leverage this especially if its samesimilar groups of people going out repeatedly can we give some extra valueincentive to those who use this over and over again which ideally is true if it is a fun and easy final judge	146				0
plan may be useful to add another column for page to organize grouped subtasks if you want to organize by page might be easier to visualize overall development structure that way	31				0
app good use of very obvious buttons and action colors blue for link to show what should be clickable and what is not in terms of mental models that part of what a user should expect is nice and straightforward interface wise the flow is not quite clear in how navigating through as a guest and as a user is supposed to differ currently it seems like just a hodgepodge of both mashed into the main screen key interaction flow that will want to be worked on next will be what happens after a user creates an event and on the flip what happens after a user joins an event how will that part of the exchange be handled to make sure the end goal for these users is met higherlevel comments below	133				0

home page its a start not quite fitting into the mobile form factor which is currently the major issue one thing that i am noticing in the current page is that its not immediately obvious what differences in functions i as a user will have when i choose one of the three forking options find explorers and nearby seem to likely to do the same thing provided i give a location by dropping the pin as the current temporary background suggests its also not too clear what surprise me would mean on the flip you may not decided that this is as big of an issue if you expect users to figure out and learn quickly what these actions do could be useful to discuss as a team and decide on moving forward	133				0
group he good group evaluation was very useful especially in the context of this course to explicitly detail which heuristics your aggregately distilled violations fit into nice inclusion of very concrete example solutions for the evaluated team to consider i also do agree that because he has limited scope it is sometimes difficult to identify or even just consider identifying problems outside of the he domain as a follow up question what are some ways that we can set up an evaluation to have both the benefits of structure and the freedom of off the page thought	97				0
individual he overall good analysis of usability for both the prototypes  discussion of comparisons between the two prototypes was very sparse however another note is that some of the severity ratings dont seem quite fitting remember that these ratings are to help the evaluated team prioritize their fixes you listed severity 1 for a few issues that didnt appear to be purely cosmetic	63				0
home page great start some things to consider moving forward top banner can probably be shrunk down to save some real estate in the mobile form factor i notice a search icon in the top right but also a search bar in the body of the page are they for different uses if so how can we make sure the user is aware of both and their uses based on the goals of your app is there any other important information that a user might want to know in the preview feed of these food items other than name and price just some things to think about	107				0
group he good aggregate evaluation nice useful concrete examples of potential solutions to the major problems found interesting considerations of one user in the context of many others the discussion of how data on the app might be used after a session was particularly insightful	45				0

would have like to see specific competitors listed also in a number of places you ask users to recall rather than recognize eg when putting in an assignment grade i have to recall what the overall weight is even when i entered the number previously when i created the assignment some styling issues as well but that does not matter at this point as we want you focusing on functionality and you have a good bit already	77				0
thank you for the clearly readable dev plans you are a little short on the functionality analytics and navigation hitting the questions link took me to a dead page but i think you are headed in the right direction especially if you shift your focus quickly once you get the input down to how people can view and interpret the responses in a meaningful way	65				0
app the village icon is the home button which i wouldve assumed is the homepage even though the mission log is the homepage further the log out button is typically pulled right on a nav bar to prevent users from accidentally clicking it while exploring the app the new mission button in mobile view is difficult to see and not very clear as to what it means these are some simple navigational elements that can impede user experience in your app when complete is clicked it does not direct to any page and instead leads to an error	98				0

dont have too many major comments on highlevel things maybe the largest scope consideration would be any power that the owner of the meeting has can they kick people can they restrict who can ask questionsmake polls etc might be useful to look into and its some set of features i might actually want if i were to use this app in a meeting  lecture etc the only other changes i have in mind right now is what we talked about in office hours about the navigation indicators kind of like breadcrumbs that tell you where exactly in the app you are for example on the page where it shows all the polls the top header can just say polls buttons can be bigger since it is for mobile	129				0

plan the main thing i would work on for your development plan is to have more specific tasks a good rule of thumb to go by is immediately actionable you want to avoid leaving tasks largely open ended like create x page theres a lot that can happen on a page one way to work around this is to group several smaller tasks under one page that way its all organized but the team and anyone reading the plan also has a good idea of what immediately actionable items need to be done tasks like you have toward the end of week 6 are better	105				0
random thought  when searching for feedback on fashion will people ever want to have multiple photosangled grouped in a single post if that were the case would you want to allow for this but place a limit on how many could be interesting to consider	45				0
as you develop your personas and prototype further keep asking why why did you select the inspirations you did why are you interested in helping this particular user  why are you choosing particular features for your app right now a lot of the analysis remains at a surface level digging deeper by trying to understand the users motivations and your own goals in designing will help address that	68				0

the point of view clearly conveys how the design is different from previous work	14				0
revisit explanation of relation to brief is there but discussion of concrete iterations through the design cycle is very very generic the first half of the paragraph could be applied to every project and not give too much insight into what specifically happened as the team worked through this first half of the quarter where did your ideas start how did they change what were some major influences etc	69				0
plan development plan tasks are too bighighlevel a good rule to go by would be tasks that are immediately actionable more specific is better for example two additional pages  theres a lot of overhead to be decided before you can actually act on this item which two pages what should be on them key links after navigation  what key links what is the skeleton work on changing this for future tasks in the development plan	75				0
like the direction your project is heading i considered the home page and tutorial page fully functional but the stats and profile pages still felt a bit like skeletons focus on functionality this week	34				0
appreciate your thinking on aligning with the brief had trouble viewing parts of the app so could not really test the navigation but as i recall from class much of the navigation was there though pages still needed to be fleshed out and the surveys were pretty minimal at this point think along the lines of how to motivate people to take the surveys what data they will get out of them not just what their employers will get and ways to do multifaceted data collection	86				0
i was a little unclear on what changes you planned to make and which you had made already also your assignment dashboard felt more like a skeleton than a fully fleshed out page however as discussed in studio i am more concerned that you think deeply about how to motivate and encourage students rather than just provide a central place for them to track grades focus on your user needs and dont get too sucked into coding a feature that does not directly address them though you should spend significant time developing this week	94				0
more detail in the revisit brief paragraph more functionality for the two screens good skeleton tho	16				0
prototype navigation is clean and mostly there so good job on that i also like that the functionality is simple and not too cluttered one thing is that it is still unclear what your pov is from looking at the app you want your app to stand out from other fitness apps myfitnesspal fitbit etc for example one thing lacking from fitbit is that when not wearing a fitbit or when not competing with friends users often arent as motivated to exercise because it isnt being monitored think about how you app can improve upon that intrinsic motivation problem	99				0
he changes do not see strong evidence that some of these changes were implemented in the app so far in fact change 11 is actually still pretty present  as a user it looks like i can click the schools on the front page but nothing happens technically you implemented change 13 but thats not quite an important change to address the evaluations at this moment would have liked to see things like 3 11 etc at least some simple interface changes that would have a large impact on usability	89				0
plan good detail on the plan  categorizing with the title column is very useful keep going for listing immediately actionable tasks love that notes include resources for where to start digging for information related to the tasks	37				0
app  the current navigational skeleton is confusing from the first page as mentioned earlier it is already odd that the user is unable to click through any of the colleges listed after drilling down into a college the app navigation completely chances as a header and footer are added header actions dont link to any skeleton pages footer works but again inconsistent with earlier stages of the application youll want to work on making this all consistent as soon as possible as well as making sure things that users expect to happen when clicking do happen as often as possible from studio also consider what kinds of persistent userspecific information will be important for both high school users and college users when i log on and have been using this app before to set up appointments what will i want to see to check up on those what will be most important to me to make all this exchange as smooth as possible	163				0
individual he missing comparisons drawn between both prototypes	8				0
group he this group feedback touches on some important points but seems disjoint from what is to be uncovered from usability evaluation your evaluator group places a lot of emphasis on particular highlevel feature changes and only a few brief mentions of what interface improvements could be made where does usability falter when a review system is missing it may be useful to have friends and strangers meshed into one app or it may not the work needed to discover those needs falls into other iterations of the design cycle is this something you can really draw a concrete conclusion on just by testing usability this is not to say it is a bad idea to suggest to the team you are evaluating to investigate that feature choice  its great that you included it the main issue is that such suggestions overpower discussion of the usability violations and their potential solutions	151				0

great job with the video too love it	8				0
home page good start some things to consider perhaps the navigation you have at the top of your app should be a little more condensed to not take up so much space in a mobile form factor common classic approaches would be a hamburger menu or maybe just having those be tabs at the topbottom like with how facebook mobile operates similarly will it be that important to have a giant banner with the name and most recent favr requests taking up 14th or so of the screen at all times perhaps we want to save more space for the feed itself remember that space is a lot more valuable and limited when working with mobile something else to watch out for is recognition over recall  think about what symbols terminology layout design etc can replace or upgrade less telling arrows	141				0
individual he excellent organization and analysis of usability the inclusion of potential solutions in that feedback is very useful for the evaluated team it was a nice touch to clarify evaluations from the standpoints of the two main user groups the boss and the regular users as far as the extra goes yes that could definitely fall under recognition over recall and is great insight offloading the cost of specific memory into generic space is a great observation and can positively affect the users experience	85				0

great work today it was awesome seeing the improvement of your app throughout the quarter everything went smoothly and the end product of the prototypepitchwalkthroughposter were all pretty good	29				0
the redesign stems from the user testing and well reflects an underlying design breakdown or opportunity solution ab testing with it will produce informative results  not clear how user testing inspired this manipulation	33				0
specifically awesome protocol  very detailed  well formulated	7				0
much of the functionality hasnt been implemented the navigation is also still clunky as i am not exactly sure what i can do with the app and the skeleton task should be focused on the functionality rather than having user simply sign in and explore	45				0
app while the idea is creative there is still much to be done about the functionality it is unclear what to do upon logging in and doesnt really yet feel like a game a good way to introduce someone to a game app is to have them learn while playing through it its unclear what exactly the game does as well the symbols are still somewhat confusing the navigation within the pages is still clunky and doesnt provide any indication as to what those pages actually are	87				0
inspirations were good but presented without specifics if all of these apps are so good where is the opportunity for your own product	23				0
comments your point of view needs some more thought what does someone need in order to achieve a goal it all depends on what the goal is try to get more specific by thinking back to personas see scotts videos from week 2 and developing one or two example users for your app once youve done that try to refine your idea to figure out what functionality your app is providing that they cant get elsewhere	76				0

pov getting close but would still like to see a more articulated user need distilled into the pov in your design space what is it that users need to successfully try new places it seems like things were getting warmer with the description of how reviews typically are exchanged and interpreted by people what can this tell us about what core thing people need in your point of view	69				0
inspiration good discussion and organization	5				0
the pov is vague what tasks do people not want to do why do people lose motivation i would like to see more game elements incorporated into the app what do points mean how do they reward the user	39				0
great diversity in prototype designs while still working in the same design space	13				0
pov not clearly articulating core user needs your pov is a lot more focused on what the solution has to offer you need to make sure it also touches on the needs what do people need for say their social animal nature are we concerned about spontaneous unscheduled social concerns long term social bonding theres a lot of general space floating around that can be narrowed down more for a design project	72				0
those prepare for testing tasks would have probably been better set as stretch goals	14				0

there seems to be quite a bit of functionality missing eg when users clicks red x nothing happens  when user clicks green arrow it automatically jumps to dropped  wouldnt the next step be to notify the user of a match and then directions for where to drop and then allow the user to notify the system theyve dropped the food	60				0

well done on the test plan a few comments   the graphs still dont make sense i really recommend not putting in dummy data the average of the two moods also doesnt make too much sense	35				0

be careful not to focus on the solution too much the needs were very featurefocused when they should be focused on the users needs outside of technological solutions observations also need to be more clearly related to studio brief	39				0
topic is good but user needs were missing from the submission also 2nd sketch didnt demonstrate a breakdown and the 3rd observation was not very comprehensive	26				0
good work on having data update on both instructor and student side i still think your ab testing should have focused on more of the core functionality of the app changing the profile picture is a peripheral and additional functionality but not one that is really necessary for your app focusing more on the quiz play or creating a quiz aspect would have made for a more useful ab test dev plan should also specifically state which changes you will make in this upcoming week distribution of tasks has improved	90				0
some needs are too vague or not insightful	8				0
no clear activity picked more of an amalgam of various things while it was still valuable to go into these different activities not knowing exactly what you would find you want to narrow down your activity in this stage of the design cycle to gain as much insight about a particular activity as you can	55				0

the assignment required a detailed dev plan for three weeks weeks 57 only weeks 5 and 6 were planned please also be more specific in task names or you will lose points in the future ie  which pages are included in setup skeleton pages	44				0
great job with dev planplease use text wrap on cells where text is cut off so i can read it make sure each member is doing a fair amount of work for dev plans in the future please include foreseen and unforeseen obstacles which can be anything from having too many midterms one week which slows someones progress to being out of town	63				0
out of box point received for insightful and creative redesign of prototype and for implementing dramatic changes based on he and  further user interviews	24				0
would be nice to see the priority rankings listed in your he rankings present in your app otherwise well done	20				0
home page great start small feedback on just the current page so far we can utilize more screen real estate by just having the feed take up all the space rather than a bounded div moving the ask and answer buttons to the top or somewhere always reachable bottom tabs floating icons like in material design etc lots of options can allow you to fill the rest of the screen without losing visibility those key actions just something to consider	80				0
individual he good evaluation overall well organized and includes comparisons between the two prototypes as a note accidentally creating a meeting room or entering the wrong room isnt necessarily a error that you could detect as it would be on the side of the user to know whether or not that action was intentional having the ability to escape this accidental action would be more about giving users control to exit the recover from errors part of that heuristic probably led to this fuzziness but try to think about it in terms of recovering from an error that a system can actually recognizediagnose	103				0
group he good analysis of relation between usability artifacts overall goals of the app and experiences of users it is true that he is hard to hit a lot points when a prototype is primitive the level of feedback can be largely dependent on how thoroughly a prototype is fleshed out as a follow up question what kinds of things an we focus on to make he most optimally valuable when a prototype is very primitive	76				0
individual he extremely thorough and insightful usability evaluation well done you went very in depth with each violation and provided very useful feedback in the comparative portions of the evaluation great points like with the map being a strong example of recognition	42				0
good work but could have put more into it	9				0

individual he  noticed some verbatim duplicate bullets between the other evaluators be careful not to fall into too much emphasis on highlevel feature improvements rather than usability improvements i also noticed that you grouped a need for a reviewrating system under two heuristics would also like to see some deeper comparisons between the apps instead of just that both have the same issue good observation of how the name of application can affect how users perceive and use it though  very insightful	82				0

interaction flow flows love the change with the navigation from burger to tabs definitely works well with the amount of paths available to the user the one bit of flow left thats still a little fuzzy that i know your team is already working on is that from picking deliverypickup to payments and so on a lot of that was already mentioned in studio	64				0
the slide doesnt really demonstrate what the application does or looks like	12				0
first storyboard was too difficult to read and follow in the first prototype how does this differ from already existing quizzing apps  why does dressing the character matter or how will it incentivize users in the 2nd prototype what does an adventure consist of i liked that the 2nd app included scheduled breaks	53				0
github url didnt work couldnt give points for json data without this info task for testing wasnt very detailed or concrete a better task would be to ask user to complete a chore and verify it	36				0
app i liked the flipping card portion great functionality the tutorial page doesnt lead anywhere you should have it lead to some placeholder page at least good functionality and navigation otherwise the symbol for your house settings makes it seem like this would be the home page even though it isnt you may want to change that to have a more generic settings symbol i think you might also want to emphasize the housesplitting aspect of this app and really emphasize the trading card system of it as this is the major differentiation between your app and others that may be similar	102				0
task 2sentence task isnt really a concrete task for users to do instead it describes what the app can do	20				0
competitive analysis your analysis doesnt specifically mention any of your competitors you should include specific apps that are similar to yours and compare them explicitly to show why yours is different or better	33				0
app submit button on home page is missing though the functionality is there one thing that hasnt yet been fleshed out is what happens when the user starts cooking how can the user unlock more tastebuddies    instead of having the chef icon on your recipes maybe just allow the user to see the recipe by simply clicking on the image this would seem to be more intuitive the bookmarked pages tab doesnt lead anywhere should at least lead to a placeholder page	82				0
competitive analysis 2 of the 3 apps you mentioned were geared to children you should touch upon more apps that are geared towards your target demographic like the chore wars app i linked to you in piazza	37				0
app there is a lot of text on each of the pages and a lot of scrolling you may want to think of ways to either shorten the text or make it easier to navigate through the text having the learn more and lets get started buttons in two different places are a bit redundant and confusing a better way to link these two would be to have a single button to get started and a link to the learn more underneath it it is also unclear what the levels are when level 1 stiffy appears on the page i was unaware of what this meant	106				0

good job overall as a note on metrics for testing timing may be a hard one for distilling insights another potential metric o maybe think about is whether or not one design is more conducive of using the category options as you noted in your tests some users just wanted to jump straight to search essentially a question of exploration vs premeditated want  would different designs influence how much users explore rather than directed search could be an interesting question not required at all just leaving it out there for thoughts	91				0

prototypes 2 not clear how the flow of the application works when looking at the prototype there are two options on the first page list and random when clicking list you are taken to the random screen for rouletting popular foods is a list then created from choosing from the random wheel what then is the purpose of the dice rolling icon on the first screen not clear how all of these elements connect and how the flow should be directed	81				0

overall i think it was great that you covered multiple avenues through which people decide to make book purchases most people will simply jump on the conclusion that there should be a catchall app that everyone can use and viola textbook exchange solved however as you have observed it is important to consider design opportunities everywhere in bookstores social media online marketplaces etc	63				0

he changes nice organization and prioritization of violations for changes very handy to separate changes done and changes todo for the filtersearch i think it can still be deconfused a little bit more with a field for text and a dropdown for certain categories its not immediately clear how the flow is supposed to work there my current mental model things that they should be separate if thats true you might want to physically decouple the filter dropdown from the search i assume the dropdown is to reorder the information that is displayed and the search input is to drill down to more specific information on the same line it looks like they are supposed to be used in conjunction before hitting the search icon	125				0

plan may want to work on breaking down what the shopping cart page should contain especially core interactions sometimes its also best to have tasks that have strong measurability in success look into sending a may be better phrased to find a resource that has a tutorial on how to etc so that you have something concrete to go off of outside constraints may also be handy placed under each respective week so they are visible when looking at that weeks plan otherwise keep it up with the specific tasks immediately actionable is a good rule of thumb	98				0

it can be hard to get the hang of critiquing others work you might have the tendency to assume that if something is confusing to you the fault is your own but this type of heuristic evaluation is specifically meant to put the person creating the prototype on notice about any and everything that might be wrong with their design	60				0

insp good analysis of different inspirations to draw from using a feed is a really interesting idea recency relevance of past experiences is something that can definitely change an entire design experience	32				0
great job with the prototypes and clever ways of representing certain interface interactions dont worry too much about spending time on certain elements of the prototype if they wouldnt be too important of a design decision at this stage for example the login screen with typing etc there may not be that much to gain from testing that interaction at this stage with a prototype unless you go for something more novel in how you log users in	78				0
in general it wasnt immediately obvious where the two prototyped solutions critically deviated in highlevel design it seemed like they were both in the area of an inventorymarket for renting out equipment knowing exactly what core design decisions make an appprototype what it is will be important for iteration more distinguishable prototypes is very useful for such iteration thinking about the discussions and feedback had in class may help with bringing out the focus on core areas of design for your solution	82				0

points off for  less than 15 violations in total found	10				0
well done overall but you didnt have any explicit comparison of the two prototypes as far as your feedback goes i think your advice was solid but could have been rephrased at times if two buttons do the same thing make their text match  maybe better to say if two buttons on different screens do the same thing make their text match another suggestions you made was to provide help if a button is confusing i think thats good advice but incorporating it also means considering the tradeoffs present between giving lots of help and suggestions and maintaining minimalist design and enabling flexibilityefficiency of use for example every time i open  the github desktop app a mini tutorial teaching me how to use the app and git shows up i have never gone through the tutorial and usually close it but it still shows up every time i use the github app which is now not very often	158				0

dev plan a lot of things are still in progress make sure you have good communication with the team to get stuff done still quite a bit of functionality left to go so carefully work out the next weeks plan also a lot of these items are pretty fuzzy  not a lot of concrete actionable tasks for week 6 makes it harder to get them done have tasks such that the measure of completeness is implicit in the task that which gets measured gets done	85				0

misc app stuff i think flow wise because of how simple the app is most of that is pretty in order its a lot of functionality work now especially since you have a decent amount of dependence on some third party applications make sure you can find a way to get that done and if its too complicated ensure that you have a backup plan for wizard of ozing it by the end of this week you want essentially a minimum viable product that can successfully let your user find their next adventure so you can get the best results out of testing surprise me is pretty straight forward so i would put a good amount of effort into getting at least one of find explorers or the map working so that a real flow exists ideally the map since it seems like the main feature	146				0

interaction flow main navigational deadend issue right now is with your menu not being functionally implemented yet technically you can back enough times to get to another point but a user shouldnt have to do that  most blocking thing right now in terms of flow  other than that the other major consideration i would give to flow is with the renting out your gear path that we talked about in studio there can definitely be a more condensed while still guided if thats what you want to go for way to request input for renting out some gear	98				0

prototype i think you guys did a great job considering you are a now a group of 2 the navigation is clean and functional i liked the simplicity of understanding in your site suggestions try to think of how your app might stand out from other fitness apps think about why those apps are successful and where they might be lacking a minor suggestion would be to have a home page so separated from the home page so that when you click on wefit you go to a home screen rather than your profile also it was difficult to tell which were plans to be implemented from your hes and which were actually implemented	114				0
development plan wellthought out and organized one thing to think about is scaling your development plan to 2 people and how youre splitting up tasks ie by estimated time skillset pages etc also your paragraph revisiting the brief should mention how the design process you have learned up to this point have helped you in applying the studio brief	59				0
prototype the major navigation is present and has a nice simplistic design it is still unclear that the purpose of the app is to challenge friends to complete tasks it might also be useful to have some placeholder examples in your what do you have to do today section so the user is fully aware that this is where they need to type tasks because this is a challenge a friend kind of game you might want to make the task list seem more competitive than simply a task list	90				0

prototype good job so far with the navigational skeleton some of the changes that were stated as implemented did not seem to be implemented ie no login option from guest mode navigation was good but again you will want to have a back button or clear nav bar on all pages be sure to make your site responsive to mobile size make the aesthetics consistent throughout the site  minor suggestion for the locked questions you might want to put a small padlock symbol by it so its immediately obvious that the question is locked	94				0

a couple fixes to your app in this final week there should be some way to edit your friends list ie rename delete friends again there should be some confirmation as to how many points it takes to level up or whether checking in with multiple friends is better than 1 or none etc a stretch goal for some of the gamification elements you guys were mentioning could be to have challenges or quests ie check into a lunch place with a friend or check in with 2 or more friends this could also help with solidifying your pov	99				0
some of the heuristics for match between system and real world would better fall under familiar metaphors and language aggregate evaluation should have more potential solutions for violations	28				0

interaction flow functionality wise everything is pretty well connected and primary functionality is there now its time to fix things up for usability on the mobile form and to work on some of the clarity of use as noticed in the studio sometimes it wasnt exactly clear what was being viewed on the home page with the whole which favrs am i doing and which ones are other people doing i think its a good start to try to delineate that by only showing completed buttons for the favrs you are doing but we can probably do better even going back to the drawing board with wording of the two categories might help sounds weird but even something where favr isnt in the phrase can be clear too for me for others with a general favrs title above both my example might not be the best but hopefully it helps trigger some potential changes	154				0
small git note might want to move your code to an actual separate repo your repository is still technically forked from lab4 so its kind of a hugely iterated lab4 having a new repository for your project is a bit more appropriate and maintainable for longevity	46				0

competitive analysis lacks depth and detail your app is very unique and it would have been very easy to explain how functionality differs from the general market however your description merely brushes over these unique features and does not make a competitive analysis	43				0
competitive analysis good mention that there are not really games that tackle social anxiety or inhibition	16				0
app i like the core functionality of checking in there still needs to be some confirmation of after you check in some features to think about implementing are different point values for checking in with friends vs checking in alone a way to change mood or assess mood when hanging out with friends a way to post pics while hanging out etc good simplistic design	65				0
app great simple navigation there are some symbols in the shop section that are not very clear as to what they mean ie the gold transfer overall great functionality though think about what you want to happen in the app as the user is on an adventure	47				0
you said tooltips could be helpful in this case to point out what a particular section actually means remember that apps are being designed for a mobile context as such hover text doesnt really exist	35				0

very impressive changes to the app since last week however this team consistently overlooks the importance of written portions of the assignment and fails to make requested changes if you are having trouble with this please see me in office hours or post on piazza	45				0
there was no context for duration while entering the detail of an activity it is used nowhere in the application 3   violation of consistency if you ask for a length of time and its not used in the app then theres a problem	43				0
adding a location and timing option for each class added would be helpful currently the user has to navigate into a specific class to delete it it would be much easier if the delete option was there on the main page that lists the classes 2  again flexibility and efficiency of use	52				0
ended up adding a club to favorites twice somehow	9				0
edit added points back	4				0
while it is good to ab test small changes dont be afraid to make significant changes this week to your styling while youre in good shape i think your app could see some significant improvements in minimalism and ease of navigation whenever you find yourself thinking that your app is just inherently complex question that assumption	56				0
observations great detail on the protocol	6				0
alternative design testing good that you accounted for the sell button tests dependence on a user actually wanting to sell something i would definitely recommend performing analysis on the data from each of the alternatives separately as well as combined	40				0

are your analytics hooked up to actual user behavior or just canned data id encourage you to keep refining what you show people by going back to your original pov and asking what visualizations can help people address your original problem	41				0
also your ab test needs to look at user behavior not what they report in a survey chsquared tests are for comparing rates of binary behavior such as click through not ratings on a likert scale	36				0
a couple thoughts on your ab test will you be able to test the value of historical results if you are just giving people canned data for those results i agree that showing history could be valuable but question whether you can get accurate test results just by showing fake data for people also for the employees move away from aggregating results in a pie chart  to timeseries graph most likely a line chart since people are more likely to want to see trends in their responses over time  eg why did i give low ratings last month rather than just knowing that 30 of all their responses were in a particular category youre getting there but think a little more about how you show employees and employers the results and how you help them reflect on those results go back to your original pov for fresh inspiration	148				0

when using across multiple devices i could join the same room awesome work  yet some other things dont quite hold the mute and pause buttons arent visible on mobile device music didnt seem to want to play on phone even though could see the time incrementing  note the app does work on a phone just doesnt have full functionality  please ensure so in next assignment	65				0

online test results testing is hard nice to see you documented all the difficulties and bumps along the road the drastic difference between actual user preferences and data is pretty intense but yes i would agree that a lot of the variance you all found is probably caused by some other factors in the experiment as a whole conclusions and analysis could in general be a little bit more clear especially with two different tests run little descriptions of what the original and what the variation was would be useful	90				0

prototype im really impressed with the effort you put into redesigning your idea and paper prototyping i think you were able to glean insights that you were stuck on before and it seems that youre more confident in your idea now the simplistic design is great the only thing that its missing is a log out button but this can be implemented for future assignments the interactions are still a bit clunky and illdefined in terms of the symbols also the back button and help button seem to be stretched in the web version	94				0
development plan great development plan i really liked that you included stretch goals and a discoveries section	17				0
prototype i loved the animation very creative and wellimplemented early in this stage the navigation overall is very simplistic and well thought out a couple suggestions the scrolling mission log is overwhelming might be useful to collapse them and make them individually expandable the mission frequency circles were misaligned when resized to mobile so it was a bit confusing to know which frequency is chosen when i hit enter after entering a subtask i was expecting to be able to create another subtask but was sent straight into my mission even though i hadnt finished writing out my tasks as a bonus you might want to also add a time component to a due date so that users can also set what time a task is due	127				0

your implementation is a bit behind what happens after the user orders  when an order is complete how does the user pick up the food a simple address would suffice again wizardofoz work is fine but it should still allow a user to fully complete a goal getting food in this case there is no way to pay not even a fake pay now button and no way to get your food i would like to see an example of an order with a status of complete to know what are the next steps also you added ratings to the dishes but did not implement a rating system in short tie up all loose ends	115				0

alternative designsexperiments in general you have a lot of proposed experiments they can work together but just make sure that this is planned carefully be ready to explain that any experiments you run in parallel dont interfere with each other and potentially mess up each others data	47				0
observations great detail with the protocol whew its been quite an adventure with these naming conventions to avoid future issues with this maybe consider some alternative ways to represent who is providing a favr for who i remember some directional arrows toward the beginning of the quarter perhaps some variant of this might help metaphors to the real world   recognition over recall are good baselines for some sort of quick redesign here	72				0
in general i dont think this is the most valuable alternate design that you could be tackling with ab testing shrinking information down to one screen seems just like a simple interface improvement i would consider thinking about some different alternative designs to test there are a lot of other big opportunities from your user observations different ways to fill out event information different ways to view your list of events etc	72				0
changes for the location since youre already working with apis it may be useful to look into google placeslocation to simply autocomplete locations can make that part a whole lot smoother	31				0

observations good detail on your protocol nice insight and appropriate list of changes good job	15				0
alternative design interesting choice for ab test i might even consider some different wording to make the contrast even larger it seems like youre going for implicit action result vs very explicit action result that describes exactly what clicking the button will do cant decide click me is still pretty open ended and also might deter someone who isnt necessarily indecisive but would still be interested in a random suggestion perhaps something very direct like give me a random or show me idk something very directly descriptive to make the contrast bigger between the two designs up to you just some food for thought	104				0

overall welldone the third picture doesnt show a breakdown or design opportunity i know you say that jeremy needs to work consistently without feeling tired and pressured but you dont address the fact that earlier he says that he uses this time pressure as a way to motivate himself to finish his work it seems like theres more to understand here about why he works the way he does and how his situation might be improved	76				0
many of your needs assume a solution for example 1 says user needs an application why do they need an application your answer to that question is what should be written down	32				0
many of your needs were redundant you seem to be using breakdown and design opportunity interchangeably a breakdown would be the specific point at which something goes differently from the users expectation a design opportunity is just an idea based on your observations for a problem that needs to be addressed none of these should be too specific about how the need is addressed at this stage	67				0

presentation was creative and definitely memorable but the beginning part could have been rehearsed bettercut short	16				0
app one huge piece of the skeleton and flow that i dont quite see is organization pages i imagine organizations would have some info to be able to be drilled into via list of orgs and maybe even in your profile for orgs that youve matched into how is that part of the app going to be navigated to and fro seems important especially if a big part of your app is to connect people to orgs for interaction not just matching some notes from studio feedback on yes  feedback on no weird button names after adding something to your interests system status on how many orgs you need to cycle through	112				0
plan a good amount of specific steps be careful with some of the tasks you want them to be as immediately actionable as possible  for example develop movement between screens of the app could be more specific in what that means otherwise it would require extra mini tasks beforehand to figure out what that movement means before actually doing the implementation  same goes for creating skeleton pages for pages we might need  can we be more specific here	78				0
plan nice plan keep working with immediately actionable tasks	9				0
revisit would have liked to see more discussion of concrete insightchanges throughout iteration in the design cycle a lot of this seems like fluff that isnt too specific to your teams experience working through to this current point  what in needfinding he and prototyping led you to making a better app your initial idea was matching a person to a club right now the model also looks like the main actions are to match someone up or view a list what is it in your idea now that illustrates the new experience you are hoping to design you mention interacting and connecting with organizations but thats still very vague	109				0
plan pretty solid plan keep working with specific immediately actionable tasks moving forward it might actually be useful to add another column that categorizes which pages the work is to be done on since it appears youre already making that distinction in all the tasks i like that you have tasks outside of just development like finding design inspirations	59				0
he changes good job im particularly interested to see how the twitter follower model will turn out  really good to think about how other models work to decide on how to build your own youre probably already thinking about these but dont forget to also consider some of the smaller he evaluations like wording flow with actions etc	58				0

assignment was incorrect about suitable variable for chi squared so point was given you must convert your number of pageviews to a different variable that classifies the users into one of two categories since its confusion youre after maybe just classify users based on whether or not they went to the edit page after they added hard to understand exactly what youre after you can also use pageviews and a ttest to compare the groups that way up to you redesign is not functional currently dont really see the difference between the two urls	94				0

both createanimal and createanimaltext links went to createanimaltext but otherwise everything looks good you have hit upon some great insights and it is clear that you have taken these insights to make tangible changes	34				0
prototype 1 is strong  nice work  prototype 2 is too similar to 1 be sure to think outside of the box especially if youre doing an event app as this has been done many times before	36				0
storyboard 1  please post complete storyboard as discussed on piazza via private post  ensure that future submission contain all required material	21				0
good redesign	2				0
first storyboard has a shallow user need i need to see peoples photos is not a human centered need second storyboard does not demonstrate an implementable prototype	27				0
pov does not articulate connection to studio brief or a user need	12				0
deductions  point off for complete functionality i cant add a class to any past classes each button to a previous quarter is a placeholder for an empty screen	28				0
good to see the progress and the deep thinking about the testing and the results however your expected results were not calculated correctly use the rate of conversion from version a as your expected values in version b not just assume that everyone will convert	45				0
wanted to see deeper analysis of what the results imply beyond just wanting more test subjects also did not see any suggestions for changes based on your ab test or any of your proposed changes added to your dev plan  still some development to do but i think you can make the changes you suggested in the next week and polish your analytics page are you planning to hook up the analytics to reflect any of peoples actual reading activity	80				0
missing last weeks development plan	5				0
really great testing your prototype is almost there but i was hoping to see the analytics and rankings pages update when you walk around a building or at least that the name there would reflect the name on the account also there was a bug where some of the values showed as nan	53				0
point off for look and feel is reflective of a finished prototype this kind of goes hand in hand with the previous one the placeholder pages for quarters need work right now too much appears to unfinished	37				0
great rap as usual haha love the creativity	8				0
comments  well done getting all the classes from the ucsd site	11				0
overall great detail with observations in both the commentary and photoscaptions i think its a good start to figuring out the needs of this particular activity it would have been extra helpful to have some more observation on how these people communicated with those who they share the space with to see what kinds of workarounds they typically engage in	60				0
needs a lot of redundancies and a lot of needs that are very surface level based on the discussion i have written above try to think about what people really need from the activity of schedule exchange not so much what they really need from current implemented interfaces	48				0
needs a few redundancies	4				0
photos photossketch and caption should demonstrate a breakdown or design opportunity not just any scene in the story	18				0
also be careful to detail how your observation process goes earlier on in the document in seems like most were observed but one had used a diary	27				0
very interesting problem space of personal instructors to consider some things to think about would be how other professional teaching exchange systems work instructors for hire from official intuitions perhaps one way to increase the reliability on both sides of the tutor and student would be to even just give it a facade of being a professional system rather than an under the table transaction could it be that both parties dont really work as professionally because having the same peer status undermines professional respect would be interesting to find out the answer to that	95				0
needs a number of redundancies in needs what are the true motivationsneeds that cause these users to do what they do	21				0
overall you did a great job with your observations and commentary this is a great problem space that will undoubtably be relevant for a long time good detail on exactly where the pitfalls were for people in this application process in the scope of this assignment it makes sense to limit your activity to the scope of one application process since it would be trivial to try to cover all types of application systems however in the future it may be useful to include some explanation validating the use of one particular process to study the activity as a whole again in the scope of this assignment not as big of a concernwasnt required	114				0
needs theres a number of redundancies in the needs listed they could also be a little bit more critical of the activity and what insightful things you observed dig deeper for core motivations for example  what different reasons and motivations cause people to act differently in shared spaces when at school dorms vs family homes are there needs here that might open up interesting design opportunities	66				0
observationschanges great detail i like the thorough notes and clear connection to changes insightful find on users wanting to just jump to search rather than manually checking through categories	29				0
good progress nice to see that the prototype is fitting better into mobile form factor	15				0
photo documentation i like that you included quotes from the user testing in the captions really helps make the documented data feel more human and relatable later when digging for insights	31				0
nice work itd be great to see more outside of the box thinking when it comes to transportation  get creative	20				0
changes interesting that it was not obvious to someone that the app was geared toward ucsd will be cool to see how the experience of the app might change when you do make that more obvious	36				0
good topic only thing is that the 3rd photo and caption doesnt really show a breakdown	16				0
good needfinding	2				0
on the right track just needed a few more photos ideas and clearer description of your observations	17				0
creative topic and good needfinding i liked the three personas you used	12				0
no photosbreakdowns described	3				0
looks good just need another interview and a few more ideas	11				0
user needs are framed as user wants  these are very different things so ensure to distinguish them in future assignments moreover each want is prefaced with students  observing three people does not make for generalizable data across the entire student body	41				0
if you test the duration spent on a page do not use a chisquare test unless variables can be binarized ie clicked vs not clicked points will be taken off next week if tests are performed incorrectly ab tests on duration will typically use ttests ps  in industry chisquare tests are used much more often	55				0
ensure to not articulate needs as solutions  second photos description does not articulate a formulated breakdown	16				0
well done you didnt give an explanation even a short one about how your observed activity related to the brief	20				0
your breakdowns and needs are too focused on the solution that you want to create	15				0
great work only thing is that your 2nd photo didnt clearly demonstrate a breakdown it wasnt clear what the student was doing or what was on his screen	28				0
in response to your question  how they would curate  travel route remember how someone would do something can be very different to how they actually do something  in future user testing ensure you are making this distinction also ensure that needs are not articulated as solutions	46				0
nice work  take care to not articulate needs as solutions	10				0
great work with the interviews and observations while there are 15 needs presented satisfying rubric criteria seems as if there is the potential for more of the box needfinding which i look forward to reading about in future assignments	39				0
its good that you noticed some of the confusions with the app and are actively trying to fix them these specific changes should be noted in your dev plan think about why your app is unique in order to include that in your pitch next week looking forward to your presentation	51				0
you cannot use chi squared test on continuous data such as time a ttest is the appropriate test to use here	21				0
the result of the controlthe a scenario should actually be the expected where did you get the expected numbers 720 and 2142 you cant conclude from the chi squared that version a is the winning version the best conclusion you can make is that a and b version are not different with 76 confidence	54				0
most of your proposed changes are surface level changes	9				0
great job at your app and presentation im very happy that you all found this creative idea and implemented it so well  it was great having yall in my studio	30				0
your development plan items need to be immediately actionable eg logo is not an immediately actionable item draw 5 candidate sketches for logo makes clear what the necessary action is owner should be a single person include outside constraints such as other projects or midterms as part of your weekly budget	51				0
your idea regarding anonymity and collaboration needs to be exploredexplained further as very often anonymity actually drives away empathy	19				0
he violations with a 0 severity rating dont need to be mentioned in your list deductions for navigation  there was some confusion as what was intended by different screens when reviewing after your presentation  paragraph does not state explicitly what your app does which makes it hard to see how it is connected to the brief the paragraph says what you did prototypingstoryboarding but not how those processes affected your final designhow your design changed over time	77				0
navigational flow still needs some more thought youre showing the input screen and the results o f inputting an entry on the same sreen at once which means youre not thinking about how things are laid out before anything has been input	42				0
re rob haitani video watched today in lecture  dont put redundant information when screen real estate is so limited eg housing jobs schools buttons directly above housing jobs schools  if you think they arent redundant then make this more obvious	40				0
no third screen is present therefore lacking both functionality and navigation	11				0
development plan is a little too sparse and each item should be an immediately actionable item for example work towards interactiveprototype is not an actionable thing that you can sit down and start on	34				0
each item should have a single owner even if everyone will contribute this ensures that someone is accountable and personally responsible for seeing work for it gets done	28				0
more effort put on functionality than on navigation here a few points off for the navigation lacking flow but otherwise overall good	22				0
your he evaluations were thorough and reflect the evaluators experiences at a deeper than surface level good job	18				0
good video  questions i recommend checking out dan russels seminar this spring when it is announced in class because he covers both of these questions really well dans work actually involves observing people in their own homes in an unobtrusive manner to observe as realistic behavior as possible	48				0
i like the idea of making the org page more of a portal worth revisiting instead of a static list	20				0
i like the very unique approach to interviewing the freshman though most people focus on asking about the negatives but you chose to inquire more on the positives	28				0
prototype to get the best results out of testing a prototype you wouldnt want external labels and explanations of how it works otherwise the feedback given back from the user might be a little too informed	36				0
good to see divergent ideas eg not just a similar solution over and over within each interview though your inclass and freshman interviews tended toward similar ideas	27				0
good work  strive for more depth	6				0
prototype specific insights from the interview werent applied too much seems more like a general catchall motivation machine ajays case seems to revolve a lot around scores and exams how might we redesign the experience to maintain motivation for him when that happens	43				0
clean slides and poster solid walkthrough good stuff make jj get some sleep	13				0
what new dimension will you bring to the table of  ever popular tourist app try discussing with a more specific user group  for instance for those who dont travel why is that the case	34				0
impressive work guys congratulations on winning most elegant solution	9				0
great job only thing was that some of the violations could be further elaborated on in your bullet points as to why they are usability issues good comparative analyses	29				0
great job only thing was there wasnt enough comparative analysis between the two prototypes and a couple of the nonheuristic issues were missing severity ratings	25				0
great work only thing would be to add a specific severity rating for each violation rather than for the entire heuristic as a whole	24				0
when you have time can tidy up some interface styling now	11				0
functionality a lot of things are still pretty mocked together friends groups voting editingadding items to vote on influence use count etc profile and settings are bugged	27				0
notes  definitely consider what you users will try to do if they want to reroll after the whole restrictions thing	20				0
still not really clear how the friends group will be utilized	11				0
functionality nice that the favorites are working now one bug though you get logged out when you try to search  probably not intended behavior	24				0
dev plan awesome job taking things a step further and implementing some database things	14				0
random notes  on signup i tried clicking the entire interest tag instead of just the checkbox to select it	19				0
when you have time can work on some styling to enhance the interface for things like matching the club pages all that jazz	23				0
nice animations	2				0
he should focus on general usability and functionality rather than on the detailed features of the prototype also should include a comparative analysis of the 2 prototypes as opposed to just listing the violations of each prototype	37				0
homepage url ensure youre completing the assignment	7				0
ensure youre completing entire assignment eg severity ratings  an easy way to do this is to look over the rubirc before you submit your assignment to ensure youve completed all aspects also a login page is not a home page	40				0
love that you added a screenshot of a particular suggested interface well done	13				0
revisit a lot of these do not fit into how are you different from  why would people use your application instead of  in what situations would people use  instead of your application	32				0
some of the violations you mention were not wellcategorized into the given heuristic there was no indication what the different colors meant so i was unsure as to what they signified also no severity ratings given nice homepage link	39				0
fantastic job with the app looking pretty much complete in functionality to me everything else is also well in place  dev plan links etc	24				0
one thing that i would definitely change is indicating somehow that the buttons that arent clickable in the menu arent i remember observing people trying to click it in studio	30				0
here are some considerations for some other possible changes  live update but youre already working on that p	18				0
notes  i like how youve set up the two users to expedite the testing process	15				0
i would look into httpsdevelopermozillaorgenusdocsmozillamobileviewportmetatag to make things look a bit more fitting on an actual mobile phone	18				0
a lot of functionality progress since the last time nice	10				0

it looks like the brunt of the work is on andres shoulders i dont see a single commit from grant is he pair programming with someone	26				0
update thanks for submitting a working link reroll function still not functional but otherwise pretty complete	16				0
the app as it is is not yet ready for testing as the quiz play mechanics are not fully functional i noticed on the dev plan that there is a pretty unequal distribution of work which may be the reason you are behind tasks should be evenly divided so as not to overwhelm any person especially since you are a group of 2 if youre having group problems please come see me	72				0
dev plan i understand it was a struggle with the api business	12				0
prototype link didnt work cannot give points for app functionality please send an updated working link to app for points to be awarded	23				0
the analytics page doesnt provide any sort of concrete information about the total amount of time spent doing each task the pie chart should tell me how long spent in each category and also total time spent timing goals in a day	42				0
another note  i noticed in your commit log that shuyu has not made any commits i did not subtract the point for evenly distributed work but is there a reason for this  please explain briefly  in your assignment 8 submission	40				0
i shouldnt be able to edit a task that is currently being timed edit button should be greyed out in that case	22				0
i dont see the option to set goals in the future it seems like this is a timer simply for the immediate time	23				0
nicely done especially the video	5				0
not a point of view an example of a point of viewthis is just an example might be there are times when we feel inadequate or as if were not living our life to its fullest by reminding us of the highlights of our lives both the sad and happy we can reexperience those moments and learn more about ourselves becoming better individuals	63				0

inspirations lack competitive analysis  what other resources are currently available to address this user need eg quick google search brought me here httpwwwrescueorgusprogramussandiegoca what can you learn for their efforts	30				0
testing the noise level of the environment is super cool you can make it more intuitive and get rid of the instructions by displaying a testing  countdown of seconds until it finishes the test which would give you a cleaner look as well new tutorial looks greatsame modal box screen size when looking through tutorial would be a good minor fix	61				0
ab feedback to use for a9 make sure the features you are testing are quantifiable changing the color will not suffice as an ab test testing rate of added environments or rate of clicks to test sound because of the implementation of a tutorial or change of the test sound layout would provide meaningful data in the writeup you fail to specify quantifiable data or specific trackable changes that can be analyzed with statistical tests	75				0
