734,"For the foot scale, you can incorporate the bar similar to inch scale so when the user attempts to fix their posture, that bar gets filled up, then move on to the next step.",34,,,
415,not seeing a data file anywhere if it exists tell me to get the point back,16,,,
768,could have elaborated more here this is arguably the most important part of doing an evaluation of two prototypes together talk more about the brief how did they compare in actually meeting the design objective,35,,,
505,extra credit awarded because of your consistent hard work throughout the quarter great usercentered design your video made me smile,20,,,
1016,maybe its because you decided to keep the first page simple in which case consider the rubric item to be met but there is scope for many useful interactions to be afforded to the user on this page itself to avoid further clicks to get somewhere,46,,,
510,i would keep it more precise such as using only your last statement and changing the wording of that slightly,20,,,
144,old events also affect for todays suggestions,7,,,
772,"I can see what you're trying to do with the arrow, however, I feel as if a 3D symbol would be slightly confusing. Maybe just have an arrow that shows directions from a top-down perspective?",35,,,
496,some pages like affordability have dead ends no back buttons and dead links the hamburger menu is not functional,19,,,
634,text and color combinations dont go well together the text is also not wellaligned and is overlapping each other its unclear what the garden here is exactly,27,,,
327,its unclear from the video what exactly the purpose of the app is,13,,,
557,it would be better if the cancel button the one that appears when the add friends button was clicked was more visible,22,,,
45,good level of detail,4,,,
24,great write up,3,,,
219,point of view does not state the core problem,9,,,
368,this submission looks identical to dannys for the feedback please check out dannys submission,14,,,
713,"I might expand upon the weight graph, also overlaying it with your dietary information and workout schedule from days before to grant the user some intuition into how those factors affect their weight",33,,,
206,its unclear what the purpose of this page is,9,,,
468,the racing component is not clear from this video prototype but the other components clear so point awarded,18,,,
696,"The interface succeed at showing all the information needed. However, it lacks information hiearchy and seemed to be a little messy. Probably have different views showing simplier information and expand as needed",32,,,
793,assumes user has a thermometer with them how are the pictures used in a scientific way generous with the point here i think the core functionality is here but the data driving the functionality isnt practical,36,,,
813,There is no save button for the predefined modes of lighting. And throwing movie in between evening and morning is kind of random. You can also set a time for different modes to turn on automatically.,36,,,
76,no data file updated 12112016,5,,,
56,not really comparative enough,4,,,
164,i wish you highlighted the problem more here,8,,,
233,great job on an interesting idea good work all quarter,10,,,
278,observations not too thorough but point awarded because breakdowns were mentioned,11,,,
37,wheres the problem,3,,,
21,too unclear,2,,,
230,edit buttons dont have any functionality and dont go anywhere,10,,,
91,2 and 3 are too similar,6,,,
651,point of view needs to be written from a generic user perspective dont use the word i to describe it it should also only focus on the problem,28,,,
79,not relevant to personal informatics,5,,,
99,i could not find the calculations,6,,,
313,try reducing the focus on interface elementsdetails phrasing it more naturally instead,12,,,
2,questionable,1,,,
363,the storyboards dont really touch upon the routine concept you mentioned in your pov,14,,,
92,a lot of focus on styling,6,,,
1355,"I wish there was an option to hide the hotekeys shortcut page since I imagine that the user will become well-versed in these shortcuts after a while and it isn't necessary to have them on the page. Maybe once that is hidden, the box with the slides could become bigger? Because right now, it is pretty tiny and considering the amount of text on some professor's slides, it would be really difficult to read the slide due to the size. Try posting some actual slides and see if you can read it easily. Also, is this designed for the laptop or the tablet? I take notes on my laptop at home but I usually take my tablet to class because it is lighter.",123,,,
751,the courseactivity dichotomy is confusing the activity text box can be used in a manner similar to an other option which only shows up when the user clicks other activity from the drop down,34,,,
51,no datajson file found,4,,,
343,try to make this more comprehensive to have fewer iterations in the future,13,,,
532,not clear at all how it relates to the brief you cant just rewrite the brief to fit your desired outcome,21,,,
540,think of what else can be done in terms of fulfilling needs that a simple note taking app will fail at,21,,,
400,each task is still quite big and hardly any planning or breaking down effort is done,16,,,
1376,"The video link is broken, so I am basing this on your written description. The content of your idea is very practical. My friends and I regularly use sites like Slick Deals in order to find the best value. I realy appreciate an app alerting me on new deals. T-Mobile does this on Tuesdays through their app and I have been jumping on those deals, so I know this works! I also really like the fact that the app is smart enough to purchase items for you. Sometimes items run out of stock and it would be great if the app would buy it for you before it runs out. I would like to see if maybe the app can ask you if you would like to buy the item though. Or if the app can check your bank account to see if you have enough money. It would be horrible to get an overdraft fee due to this app!",160,,,
1326,"For the Inch size design, I assume it is designed for apple watch. I think it is a great idea to preserve your functionality of vibrating when certain breaking news is pushed to your device. However, instead of making it an interface to read the actual article, I would make apple watch more like a reminder to remind you that there is an such news going on (or maybe shows a really brief introduction or title of the article), so that you will know you can pull out your phone or ipad to read those articles when you are on the bus.",102,,,
776,i thought it was interesting that you used logs of departurearrival times it might have been nice to also show a participant maybe walking to class to show your point of heavy traffic congestion etc,35,,,
493,overall good job and providing the external reference for the specific usability issue the other team had was great,19,,,
599,you all have made such good progress since the beginning of the quarter great work your video seemed to be a hit in class,24,,,
124,are you planning to put any images,7,,,
560,since no annotation given as to what is screen 1 i graded on the assumption that the landing page is screen 1,22,,,
450,user needs are repetitive for example 1 2 and 3 could be combined into one user need,17,,,
624,the start mission pages are also different which then adds additional variables to your users interactions will you be settling with one format vs the other,26,,,
522,you dont need to provide a solution to each user need you just need to write about the need problem,20,,,
221,the home option does not implement any primary feature,9,,,
431,good observation would there be other possible ways to make the bus ride for mei more pleasant,17,,,
484,i dont see enough detail you havent explored all the options that your app provides on the home screen,19,,,
675,plan isnt reflecting very much progress either youre not working on your project or youre not updating your plan also the home management and alarm functionality is not core functionality,30,,,
128,exceeds time limit by a significant margin,7,,,
574,if someone uses a different service say pinterest for example then maybe we can also look into a different aspect of selforganized memories,23,,,
779,im curious how it works unless youve pushed a different commit to heroku you seem to have a backupjson but that isnt used in the code let me know so i can award the point,35,,,
186,vague measures lead to vague outcomes and interpretations,8,,,
473,you can break down the tasks more into smaller bits shoot for less than 30 mins per task,18,,,
73,i like the slider functionality,5,,,
741,I'm not sure if instagram would be a great choice since it's just picture based. i usually don't find reviews on Instagram nor would I want to search for reviews of places via hashtag.,34,,,
65,1 and 2 are redundant,5,,,
709,"Going off from the comment above, I hope the we could just get rid of the weather information and set the time information on the above and enlarge the button on the bottom",33,,,
577,make sure to isolate a single difference between the two versions otherwise itll be hard to reason about different users behavior if any,23,,,
1377,"Inch: Conceptually I think this is an interesting idea, however I do not think that an inch scale device is ideal for viewing images of anything. If you are on the bus, why not use your phone or a tablet that provides a larger scale? Foot: For the foot scale, I think that the use case is much more proper. However, your use case states that the user wants to check something out in Greece. Why give all the options for places around the globe or additional places that the user doesn't want, like Jordan? Maybe provide an interface before this screen that allows the user to select where they want, it animates in on the map and doesn't show other places. Yard: Seems to me like you mostly reused the foot interface for the yard. Watching videos/viewing content on a yard scale is obviously ideal but I think you can come up with more intuitive interactions than using a game controller.",162,,,
542,try to be more clear who the target user is with a more general example or by mentioning in the voiceover,21,,,
820,"Because people may use dish washing machine everyday and the range of users is large from different cultures and ages, it's better have a clean and clear interface that people understand how to use immediately without learning.",37,,,
729,the link on the doesnt work if you copypaste it converting to pdf messes things up make sure you make it a clickable link on the pdf pdf messes up text at times,33,,,
316,you might further want to conduct comparative analysis on existing banking apps,12,,,
150,the workout picture appears to be random,7,,,
439,photos show physical features like signs or room numbers but not the users themselves navigating the environment,17,,,
328,just needs minor tweaking in terms of design such as being mobile responsive,13,,,
788,Yard: Curious as to what the input for the yard scale is. It would be cool to show relevant personalized information as someone walks up with their Apple watch and the yard interface senses it.,35,,,
764,"2) On the ""Your table is almost ready!"" screen of the inch scale, the ""I'm on my way!"" button should be significantly bigger than the ""cancel"" button. By doing this, users would avoid unintentional slips.",35,,,
610,woah good idea combining citizen science and personal informatics reciprocal benefit for the science and citizen user scientist gets data citizen gets the data analyzed,25,,,
667,what do to other tabs in the app do the prototype displayed only focuses on the training tab so im unsure of what the rest of the app does,29,,,
647,mostly make sure to clarify how the map works and change to san diego instead of london add some examples that they can click on on the map,28,,,
615,in other words its a little stretchy to claim that people expect that viewing the qa material will help them how to read a graph better,26,,,
303,pay a little more attention to the navigational flow of the app,12,,,
17,nice plan,2,,,
224,there is no older dev plan to compare to,9,,,
635,this isnt the best candidate for an ab test as it more appropriately distinguishes users exploring the app comprehensively or not rather than what is really intended,27,,,
94,data file looks a little convoluted,6,,,
548,a home button on the home screen appears redundant also the welcome message could be used as a link to the profile,22,,,
53,no real solution here,4,,,
231,good work with the new prototype its fairly substantial now,10,,,
1382,"Inch: I like the idea of being able to see how well you've slept using the watch interface but I do not think setting alarms for sleeping through the watch is a good interface, it would be easier to simply have the alarms sync from the phone. I like that you can see what you planned for breakfast to help the user stick to their planned (healthier?) choices but I don't think you need a yes or no for breakfast unless this is meant for tracking? In which case you would want the user to be able to say what they ended up having if it is different, maybe through speaking into the watch? This may just be me but in terms of drinking water your body should know when you are thirsty. If the point is to track what the user has had to drink that is a different story. It is also the same with snacks, I think it is a bit strange to have a designated snack time since it is healthier to eat the snack when hungry. (I may be misunderstanding this.",186,,,
258,while it looks nice needs more in terms of implementation,10,,,
756,theres a lot of text on the screen which makes it difficult to read in the video and also may be detracting for users users dont typically like reading lots of text in apps,34,,,
1332,"Your watch design is good but keep in mind the actual iWatch is very small, and its highly unlikely you can click the icons / even view them without some squinting so you may want to try a different UI or larger buttons, because the image depicting Khirbat en-Nahas, Jordon isn't going to be feasible when ported to the iWatch. Similarly, clicking on the tiny location markers in the globe isn't going to be feasible, and I'd suggest making use of a swiping UI (swipe left/right to change places within a countries?, swipe up/down to change continents), or Audio to specify a place",103,,,
774,"I really like the ability to track change over time at the yard display, however, I wish the user could also pull up all of those pictures on the foot display to review as well.",35,,,
655,when i start a mission i dont see the puzzle thats supposed to be there theres also not a clear instruction as to how to use the item,28,,,
641,congrats for the award it easily won a vote among the teaching staff also good job on the app hope youve had some fun this quarter in studio,28,,,
906,"For idea 1 interface, I wish you categorize all the filters(requirements) into clearer and cleaner orders and sections. The message on the top would better to put on top of the lists of future requirements because they belongs to similar funtionality.",41,,,
600,additionally how may your application differ from oneclasswhere users are paid to submit their notesor courseherowhere users can get access to tests homeworks midterms etc,25,,,
687,some bugs when you add a picture clicking on events is not specific i think you forgot a curly brace when you go to the page after clicking on a picture,31,,,
392,there is no interpretation of the potential outcomes other than we will use that one,15,,,
699,video is too long at 136 there was too much focus on the data input aspect and not enough on how the user might use the app to help train their dog,32,,,
497,still slightly buggy in the sense of certain stuff being unimplemented but ill consider it as wizard of oz,19,,,
248,same point as before new expense button doesnt do anything,10,,,
595,protocol is easy to read wellthoughtout and userfriendly it really shows what you want to test and your respect and concerns for your participant,24,,,
486,i wish the tasks were in some sort of order so in alphabetical or chronological by due date order,19,,,
299,i dont really see a script the steps are nicely detailed though,12,,,
212,navigation could do with some improvements but im nitpicking,9,,,
627,this idea of aggregation is common with many apps since your app encompasses various facets of travel rather than something singular ill give you the point,26,,,
759,Try to think about using yard interface primary as a output for each other instead of allowing users to choose food in the yard interface. Using the foot interface to choose food is better.,34,,,
409,im surprised that all commits are by a single account please talk to me about this,16,,,
158,application error the same video as before httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvznmcmmlewug,8,,,
630,if you insist on using the calendar make it multifunctional by being able to select and visualize different emotions events data over time as a colored overlay,27,,,
575,interesting observations of individuals who are seemingly doing diverse activities but great effort in trying to aggregate those activities distill some common insights,23,,,
14,limited functionality,2,,,
192,1 point extra credit awarded for functionality good work,9,,,
1158,"Because this interface will be appeared on the tablet or computer, maybe you can add a section that can modulate the lighting ambience. Sometimes some events are real-time performance. Users need to make sure that the control is correct before actually turning the machine. Therefore, haveing a section that allows users to preview the result can prevent errors from happening.",60,,,
792,"Also, if user want to upload their portfolio or art work, how do they upload them through this app ? or is there a way for them to connect the app to their personal website ?",36,,,
500,unmet profile editing search notification accept decline delete the x button on the top righthand corner are not implemented,19,,,
784,the only way to get to the income page is from the register link is this what is intended why isnt there a way to get there after the login also what does equipmentspersonal mean,35,,,
213,no mention of whos the owner of each task,9,,,
63,these arent divergent solutions,4,,,
1,pov,1,,,
727,random thought the action items could be clickable if it may be useful also how will they be different from what is on the calendar im curious to see how this pans out,33,,,
611,you might want to verify if having a game factor as such ie a tree that grows for each saving is actually what user needswants,25,,,
404,good thought but needs work talk to me sometime on how to reach a firm stance,16,,,
791,also you might want to think about striking the balance between burdening the users for managing all the data they ought to enter and the amount of value that can be generated by using that data,36,,,
339,the storyboards arent really focused on tasks more so just the planning component,13,,,
200,generic input fields arent the best way to go,9,,,
319,cant see your github to determine if this rubric point has been satisfied,13,,,
54,not high fidelity enough,4,,,
1331,"This is extemerly specifc. Well Done ! I'm looking at the interface and i'm able to understand the function of this product. The wordings are clear and I like the picture and the slider bar that represent the work out you are doing and how its affecting you. I can see myself using this a lot when im on a workout plan or just working out for fun. For the watch interface, it will be cooler if theres some motivation sense behind it. Therefore, not only i can use this interface to check my growth, it will motivate me to do better !",103,,,
245,most of these have no clear relevance to citizen science,10,,,
100,i need your github repo link,6,,,
167,its still disjointed as mentioned needs more clarity,8,,,
32,not a sharpie,3,,,
728,"Score is very important element during the football games. Therefore, it is good to have a score display for all the interfaces for users to keep track of the competition all the time.",33,,,
563,try to have more specific and actionable tasks also plan a week in advance so a5 should have tasks distributed across members,22,,,
786,What exactly is this progress circle supposed to mean? there's already a timeline shown at the bottom. I feel like this doesn't really convey much meaningful info that can't be presented concisely in another way.,35,,,
