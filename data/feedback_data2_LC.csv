could be polished more but as of now its fine to be presented,13,0,0,0
it would have been nice to include the detail of the hamburger menu,13,1,0,0
no mention about how the heuristic applies to the prototype you were reviewing,13,1,0,0
expected functionality would include changingremoving groups maybe based on when a quartersemester ends,13,1,1,0
pictures relate well with your observations but the breakdowns arent articulated as well,13,1,0,0
steps have to be shown only checking with an automated calculator is okay,13,1,1,0
also whats the idea behind populating the component menu can it dynamically change,13,1,0,0
add more facetsdata to collect and corresponding data visualiztions its still too simple,13,1,1,1
be careful not to focus too much on the solution in the pov,13,1,0,0
i will still give you the point since you talked about your problemissue,13,1,0,1
user needs should address the general audience instead of specific names use student,13,1,1,0
route planning is common in many apps execute well to differentiate yourselves properly,13,1,0,1
the quests tab doesnt have much functionality and leads to an error page,13,1,0,0
really unique idea an outofthebox idea that also serves a very practical purpose,13,0,0,1
i think you forgot to complete the last sentence of the description paragraph,13,1,1,0
you havent mentioned any breakdowns in your observations that inform these user needs,13,1,1,0
in runpage the navbar is a bit too wide use your media queries,13,1,1,0
many needs are similar or appear to be a precursor of corresponding solutions,13,1,0,0
the link didnt work please check them before submitting from the next time,13,1,1,0
some of these needs are not within the scope of mobile web design,13,1,0,0
issues raised are not always specific enough good work with the appreciation though,13,1,0,0
your github repo is not updated and it needs to be for grading,13,1,1,0
i dont think i mentioned this before your development plans design is great,13,0,0,0
notes should be more detailed than just one picture and caption per user,13,1,1,0
please tag pages properly especially if portions of the assignment are arranged randomly,13,0,1,0
would like to be taken to preferences first before seeing the chat bot,13,1,1,0
its still is a bit confusing talk to me for more nuanced feedback,13,0,1,0
where do the contributions come from what happens after they decide to contribute,13,1,0,0
this prototype doesnt really stand on its own as a citizen science platform,13,0,0,0
augmented reality with an iPad in a city would be cumbersome and embarrassing,13,1,0,1
could implement a grid to improve organization and seperation of images and text.,13,1,1,1
"design is self-explanatory, easy to understand purpose of the app from the interface",13,0,0,0
I like how the categories are easy to choose from the foot version.,13,1,0,0
I like that there is a lot of functionality with this interface .,13,0,0,0
I like the card style design to showcase different modules of the trip.,13,1,0,0

It's not very clear what the icons on the upper left are for,13,1,0,0
P.S. Bonobo is a great artist. Check out Floating Points and Four Tet.,13,0,0,0
Probably the system can help the organizer to curate the message for notification.,13,1,0,0
Switch the position of face conditions and tonight you should in yard scale,13,1,1,0
The design is kind of disorganized as there are too much information presented.,13,0,0,1
there is a fair bit of repetition in the elements portrayed in the storyboards,14,1,0,0
ps it is unnecessary to show a form being filled in lots of steps,14,1,0,0
ps use different branches if you must and keep merging into the master branch,14,0,1,0
tip please refrain from forcing git pushes which are destructive and erase previous records,14,0,1,0
the first storyboard is textheavy the last one is drawn with a fine instrument,14,1,0,0
a commentary while the app was being used would have gone a long way,14,1,0,0
good job with the logo hope youve had some fun this quarter in studio,14,1,0,0
not a problem re citizen science and uninspired even as it pertains to shopping,14,1,0,0
its hard to see how this is different from a generic note taking app,14,0,0,0
video feedback nice video i like the dramatic paper table sweep at the beginning,14,1,0,0
likedislike buttons dont function as they should and store page does not have functionality,14,1,0,0
users might still need to use the manage events page to edit an event,14,1,0,0
interesting idea but why would people care about growing their garden whats the reward,14,1,0,0
next week onwards please test your app properly so that obvious mistakes are avoided,14,0,1,1
according to the rubric there needs to be 15 needs i only see 3,14,1,0,0
after creating a group i didnt see it added to the my groups page,14,1,0,0
only 4 heuristics described and explained also needs to list out full heuristic name,14,1,1,0
tip a list form is more appropriate since it helps you succinctly phrase violations,14,1,1,1
1 not clear 2 not detailed 3 detailed but focuses on the wrong things,14,1,0,0
clicking send when there is no text causes a chat bubble to still populate,14,1,0,0
close enough some of the pictures being unclickable can be considered a dead enderror,14,1,0,0
with regards to experiment 1 its hard to get good assumptions off of time,14,1,0,0
your point of view wasnt clear though the prototype does connect with the storyboard,14,1,0,0
because the pov is incorrect the storyboards are not engaging with the pov correctly,14,1,0,1
as mentioned earlier there is no need satisfaction at the end of your board,14,1,0,0
please do not hesitate to visit my or others office hours in the future,14,0,0,0
For your first pass and second pass aspect why not just integrate with webreg?,14,1,0,0
"I like how scoreboard is visible on the smart watch, great use of space!",14,1,0,1
I like the idea of the modular design. It allows flexibility for different circumstances.,14,1,0,1
I really like the idea of using AR technology to solve this challenging problem.,14,1,0,0
I would actually like to see a how would a 360 interface look like.,14,1,1,0
it would be cool if customers received texts about the cost of their meals.,14,1,1,0
Like how big the screens are but a little confused on how it works.,14,1,0,0
"Looks really professional with a clean, clear layout which gets the point across well.",14,1,0,0
Not clear about this feature? Does user use gestures to make the figure larger?,14,1,0,0
Putting all the info on the right side makes it seem crammed and unreadable,14,1,0,1
These gestures are great! But consider to add more gestures for some common interactions?,14,1,1,1
Using degree audit as the basic template would be a great choice to start.,14,1,1,0
Very interesting and informative description of both the user and the problem they face.,14,1,0,0
"When there is no donations, maybe you do not need the ""Current Donations.....Writes-offs"" part.",14,1,1,0
Why do you have dates that have already been completed on the calendar display?,14,1,0,0
someone looking at this might not understand what the times on the left side denote,15,1,0,0
a good start with the point of view but work on it a bit more,15,1,0,0
this appears to be a combination of the 2nd3rd storyboards with a more elaborate situation,15,1,0,0
what happens after setting up how can one possibly snooze routinely expected functionality appears missing,15,1,0,0
please attach the old development plan tooand talk to me after studio about this important,15,0,1,0
great work applying the historical perspective might as well grant you some interesting design opportunities,15,1,0,0
i think some needs were better articulated in your observations but didnt make it here,15,1,0,0
please mark all pages that have content matching the rubric item its fixed now thanks,15,0,1,0
still cant search playlists otherwise wouldve sounded thats a sad attempt at humor even better,15,1,0,0
you need to show a comparison of your updated development plan with your earlier one,15,0,1,0
the point of view doesnt exactly relate to the morning routine activity you focus on,15,1,0,0
user needs should address a general audience instead of specific names use students for example,15,1,1,0
but why is it important for people to be more in tune with their dreams,15,1,0,0
this is too broad too methodological personal informatics should be easier thats not adding much,15,1,0,1
be sure to explain and interpret the results in terms of test and null hypotheses,15,1,1,0
many needs are similar im happy to talk about how to work on this sometime,15,1,0,0
the main page doesnt do much apart from set intervals which is ambiguous by itself,15,1,0,1
i want to see an analytics page where you can interact with fake datasee results,15,1,1,0
the plan for testing is complete but please design and provide users higher level tasks,15,1,1,0
1how will you stop inappropriate conversationscyberbullying not everyone is nice think of the app yak,15,1,0,0
really great job in observing breakdowns and proposing design changes looking forward to your finale,15,1,0,0
even though its good to use scripted questions notes should be more elaborate and detailed,15,1,1,0
its a bit difficult to understand the notes because we dont have as much context,15,1,0,1
i dont know which screen uses json data cause i cant see the json data,15,1,0,1
do make it a point to plan for at least one week ahead of time,15,1,1,0
good but need to pivot due to taboo subject seems like you are doing productivity,15,1,1,1
no dead ends but the navigation button in create task does not seem to work,15,1,0,0
storyboards are too focused on the dialogue which draws away from the high level design,15,1,0,1
some of these needs would not feasibly be attended to in the scope of design,15,1,0,0
"Does the score ever go down? If not, you may not need the down button",15,1,0,1
"For the yard scale, maybe his music should just play automatically to wake him up.",15,1,1,1
How can user manipulate with the 2D screen_ Do they still use mouse and keyboards?,15,1,0,0
"I like how the notes automatically organize themselves into headers , subheaders, and bullet points.",15,1,0,0
I like how the yard interface allows users to compare their progress with other users.,15,1,0,0
I like that it is organized by date but not that there are extraneous options.,15,1,0,0
"I like the grid background, it gives a good sense of spacing for your content",15,1,0,1
I think that the design is very clear but the keyword search is too big.,15,1,0,0
I wish I can receive message/app notification for the ride update -- just like uber/lyft,15,1,1,0
Is there a better way of accommodating gesture and voice control in the whole experience?,15,1,1,0
"Overall, I like the idea! Maybe have price comparison between brands of the same item.",15,1,1,0
price should also be shown in this pop up window. Case of recognition vs. recall.,15,1,1,1
The feedback indicating the user is close to attaining their goal is helpful and intuitive,15,1,0,0
"Upon an increase in score, a short animation or sound could add to the experience?",15,1,1,1
You should a specific task for the persona to accomplish instead of introducing the interface.,15,1,1,0
the first two activities dont clearly describe breakdowns it talks about needs without describing breakdowns first,16,1,0,1
the main page is too textual think of a more visual representation to show positive interactions,16,1,1,0
great fake login screen dont work on it anymore despite what any future rubrics might say,16,1,1,0
try to be more clear who the target user is say by mentioning in a voiceover,16,1,1,0
they appear to be a bit similar which could be fixed by better articulating the situations,16,1,1,0
the select xxx component views state change is very subtle upon users clicking on each item,16,1,0,0
game itself not functional but the start of the game as stated in the task is,16,1,0,0
i only see the sell page with any functionality the other pages dont have any interaction,16,1,0,0
although the underlying statistics are incorrect the conclusion was derived in a consistent line of reaonsing,16,1,0,0
not much of a conclusion needs more discussion about what the results tell us and why,16,1,1,0
pvalue not listed because you pvalue determines significance this should have been included in the calculation,16,1,1,1
great job if not for the bug with the back button youd have gotten more points,16,1,0,1
i wish there was a way for an investor to contact the scientist through the app,16,1,1,0
too much focus on the solution you should not already have features in mind to implement,16,1,0,0
your league pictures do not show the person in question which diminishes from examining the users,16,1,0,1
clicking on get started on the landing page takes me to httpsthebearsturninherokuappcomgetstarted which doesnt do anything,16,1,0,0
i would avoid using the tags test because that will be difficult to quantifiably measure accurately,16,1,1,1
try to avoid listing similar needs you made up by coming up with a few more,16,1,1,0
please provide a link next time ive check the repo corresponding to the app ie githubcomcse170swolewebapp,16,1,1,0
avoid using quantitative scales for your interview questions because these will not garner you good insights,16,1,1,1
ok pov but this is now taboo consider a multifaceted approach or a new topic altogether,16,1,1,1
okay pov but i think the closet has more spotlight than the actual users of it,16,1,0,1
notes provided but notes should be more detailed about the users entire process using the app,16,1,1,0
storyboard 2 3 they state a problem and a solution where a prototype is not needed,16,1,0,0
unmet but by considering the size of the team i bumped it up by one point,16,1,0,1
some aspects of the interaction missing such as how to input budgets how to make goals,16,1,0,0
please select pages carefully in this case pages for all subjects should have been marked thanks,16,1,1,1
not possible to go back to the previous page please check out the video below httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7gnemqewmxc,16,1,1,0
can still be polished in terms of layout and what possible options are possible when chatting,16,1,1,0
a watch interface for reminders is an awesome way to stay on task and deliver notifications,16,1,0,0
consider using force touch to rank the importance so it saves pixels and allows similar importance.,16,1,1,1
"For inspiration, maybe you could think about how the receipt idea could be utilized for cooking?",16,1,1,0
I like how comprehensive the choices are but I wish that language and region were automatic.,16,1,1,0
I like how it pulls the professor's rating when you search for classes you might take.,16,1,0,0
I like the color coordination! It's an easy way to identify the status of each application.,16,1,0,1
I like the simplicity of your design. It does exactly what it should without anything unnecessary.,16,1,0,1
I like the thumbs up thumbs down part as a way to filter for your interest.,16,1,0,0
"I quite lile the visual design - good font choice (sans serif), minimalist, nice color scheme",16,1,0,1
"I'm not sure about the red color, what kind of feeling are you trying to convey?",16,1,0,0
"If possible, use pictures of food instead of words when showing orders in the yard interface.",16,1,1,0
Is the calendar marked with anything? I might want to see my scheduled interviews marked there,16,1,1,0
Is the inch scale really a good interace to show 360 degree renderings of a map?,16,1,1,0
It is a really interesting topic and it is appealing to see puzzle pictures like this!,16,1,0,0
It sounds interesting and very practical. but how does the lead user hack the existing problem?,16,1,0,0
"It's a nice concept, but how does this relate to a super user and their innovations?",16,1,1,0
"Not sure about what would happen excatuly after pressing the ""add"" button for the inch size.",16,1,0,0
"On the bottom, your expiration/freq/category categories have unequal spacing and aren't centered. They have differing margins.",16,1,0,0
"Overall, definitely, a very simple and yet powerful application. I can see myself using this !",16,1,0,0
The daily digest and suggested options are a great way to relieve stress on the parent,16,1,0,0
The house board could looks a bit neater and organized rather than a laundry list style.,16,1,1,0
The visual design seems simplistic however there weren't enough interfaces for me to give effective feedback.,16,1,0,1
try to be more explicit about how it relates to shaking up status quo otherwise good work,17,1,1,0
adding a task only works partially and appears to be the most important part of the app,17,1,0,0
try to phrase the needs for a typical user rather than specific people and not by name,17,1,1,0
similar to the first prototype there are missing interactions how would you add a company for instance,17,1,0,1
also please adapt it as a mobile web app if you plan to go ahead with this,17,1,1,0
organizing tasks is too broadly phrased to give a good idea what the app assists in doing,17,1,0,1
the first storyboard should have used a thicker instrument its just not the same with a pen,17,1,1,1
its good to be comprehensive but i barely see what you might want to specifically test out,17,1,0,1
details about the data collected are fuzzy if you can clarify im happy to restore this point,17,1,1,1
online resources can be used to verify your results but the actual chisquare formula should be shown,17,1,1,0
theres no expected value calculation for the noclick condition and therefore the derived chisquared value is incorrect,17,1,0,1
you need to collect more facets of information on this screen to stay within the brief nontaboo,17,1,1,1
the wireframe images are pretty blurry so its difficult to see a lot of the finer details,17,1,0,1
a single screen is shown but even that wasnt completely explained otherwise the point wouldve been yours,17,1,0,1
its alright to be a little messy sometimes but make sure that you communicate completely and concisely,17,1,1,0
pov could probably be expanded on a bit more with why people arent motivated enough to exercise,17,1,1,0
storyboard 3 needs to have a little more detail about how the user interacts with the app,17,1,1,0
i do not see 15 needs some of the statements are should when they should be needs,17,1,1,0
the bar to enter messages does not stay at the bottom after appending text gets cut off,17,1,1,0
video feedback i liked your video great acting especially the huge satisfaction at the end thumbs up,17,1,0,0
i like how the app allows you to chat with others in real time somethings to consider,17,1,0,0
you are testing more than 1 thing by adding padding andor changing the 2 columns to 1,17,1,0,0
the user needs more orientation than the video its still a little confusing but it looks good,17,1,1,0
you havent included the names of the people on the team you whose prototype you were evaluating,17,1,1,0
is it just a map with better recommendations are there other pages or tabs to navigate to,17,1,0,0
the quests are in the same place in both urls am i looking in the wrong place,17,1,0,0
some of these needs are more focused on the gym environment rather than user behavior of gymgoers,17,1,0,0
Distance may be a better way to convey how close someone is to the next navigation change,17,1,1,0
"foot - foot scale is nicely thought out, connects both the inch and yard scales in functionality.",17,1,0,1
"I notice you have a settings button in the top corner, but I'm not sure it's needed",17,1,0,0
I think that the sketches could be better used to communicate clearly the benfits of your idea.,17,1,1,0
"Interface is simple in design - keeps essentials, not too cluttered (essentially a list of fridge elements)",17,1,1,0
"Love the concept! However, is there a way of keeping track of the specific commands you've learned?",17,1,0,0
Maybe intergrating third-party platforms such as google doc and help user to complete coursework within your app.,17,1,1,0
Next time please talk through it so it's easier to understand what is going on . :),17,1,1,1
Perhaps the car model and year could be a drop down to make it easy for users,17,1,1,1
"Really like the yard interface, I think this would be something my brother would want to use!",17,1,0,0
"The idea is super useful. However, one common fail with scheduling App is that require manual input.",17,1,0,0
Why show the courses (greyed out) that are not available? Why not only shows those that are?,17,1,1,0
take a more concrete stance this one gives a little insight but no direction to guide future decisions,18,1,1,1
take a more insightful stance this one just cuts it as there is some direction to guide decisions,18,1,1,1
how the app actually helps fulfill the need is ambiguous that should be addressed nicely explained situation though,18,1,1,0
also there is no way a user can know where the person offering a ride is departing from,18,1,0,0
try to keep details to a minimum storyboards are not meant to be elaborately illustrated good drawing though,18,1,1,1
nicely done reduce the clutter a bit and this can be a great way to see remaining food,18,1,1,0
this is too simplistic an idea to pursue for a long enough project as this well executed though,18,1,0,1
apart from addingtrashing food items i dont see any other tasks possible the app should definitely do more,18,1,1,0
if youd like me to reconsider any part of the grade let me know privately on piazza asap,18,1,1,0
true kind of obvious but it seems like citizen science apps do fail at being fun and engaging,18,1,0,1
your payment confirmation page has a dead link for get directions thats the only noticeable feature thats lacking,18,1,1,0
how are they going to analyze each others data why is this science important what questions are there,18,1,1,0
point of view should include some indication of why there is a problem or why the problem occurs,18,1,1,0
although its polished than before i think theres still some potential to enhance the apps usability and interactivity,18,1,0,0
try to be more specific about the typical user why will a middleaged freelancer use this for example,18,1,1,0
the profile page doesnt open at times buttons to add a task do nothing not even dummy actions,18,1,1,0
make sure that the summary page is better developed it seems crude as such but good work otherwise,18,1,1,0
the user needs were redundant and the point of view provided a solution overall good job at needfinding,18,1,0,0
who did what tasks this is very important especially for 4 member groups talk to me about this,18,1,1,0
not detailed enough shows that you arent working on your app very much is that true or not,18,1,0,0
datajson exists in github but it does not seem to be rendered anywhere chat messages are hard corded,18,1,0,0
user needs need to target a general audience instead of jeff michael and sean use game players etc,18,1,1,0
i wish the first screen was less cluttered i am not sure what information is on there either,18,1,1,0
not enough changes other than those filling in gaps in the previously incomplete prototype or some are vague,18,1,0,0
love the tree visualization remember what it was like a few weeks ago looking forward to your finale,18,1,0,0
be sure to mention who does which task so i can see how work was delegated among teammates,18,1,1,1
its basically there impressed so far you do have more work to do but the functionality is there,18,1,0,0
can be somewhat confusing in terms of symbols being used actually but ok enough to receive the point,18,1,0,0
what happens if the user made a mistake in creating a log item and wants to remove it,18,1,1,0
b make sure to plan at least a week in advance i might have to dock points otherwise,18,1,1,1
the 1st and 3rd storyboards a little too vague to be able to come up with prototype ideas,18,1,0,1
"Consider to increase the contrast on the ""altitude""? The light green color might not be clear under sunlight",18,1,1,1
"design is nice - minimalist, though some screens could use some restructuring to make use of excessive whitespace",18,1,1,1
"Foot scale - minimalist, simple design is good, I like the icon style and general use of space",18,1,0,0
"For the location, I think maybe the ""map view"" will be a good choice to visualize the data",18,1,1,0
Great idea because sitting all day at an 8 to 5 can be very hard on our bodies.,18,1,0,1
"I like how the user can personalize a lot of options, improving the emotional design of the app.",18,1,0,1
I like that you can view the time slots and can RSVP for a certain washer or dryer!,18,1,0,0
I like the circular interface for displaying the dealine. It is a great visual representation of time data.,18,1,0,1
"I like the color scheme, I prefer dark colors so its not so bright, but maybe less neon.",18,1,1,1
I like the inch scale use of space. I wish the foot scale can provide more historic information.,18,1,1,0
"I like the watch design with boxes. However, the sliders seems to refined for such a small interface.",18,1,0,1
I might want to see this on a hour interval schedule to visually see when I have gaps,18,1,1,1
I really like the dance idea for unlocking but would prefer that for computer login instead of email.,18,1,1,0
I really like the simplicity of the design. The landing screen looks really intuitive and esay to use.,18,1,0,1
"I think ""May"" and ""2017"" should be in the same text field because they are not independently movable",18,1,1,1
I would like to see the safety value for the hostels especially if it's a single female traveller.,18,1,1,1
"I would recommend not having the transcript shown at all times, it should be able to be hidden",18,1,1,0
I'm confused by the yard display - what is the bottom screen meant for me to do ?,18,1,0,0
Im not nure if its controls are touch screen or a mouse to the screen where they play.,18,1,0,0
It is better not place the number on top of the logo because it may affect the readablity.,18,1,1,1
"Probably you can make the clickable buttons more visable. Such as adding some shadow around the box, etc",18,1,1,0
Really like the watch interface - the speed number is huge - great design for a small screen,18,1,0,1
The Add Message modules are a bit confusing . Too many choices a user needs to click on!,18,1,0,1
This is not interesting and novel enough. You can add more functionalities and ways to interact with it.,18,1,1,1
"We critiqued this in class and that's all I can come up with. Overall it's clean and informational,",18,1,0,0
"What happens when you tap ""Start walking""? Will it show me a walking path to the lowest price?",18,1,0,0
What would be the process for user to choose the applications that they want to actually apply for?,18,1,1,0
"When the button turns green or red, the text should change to reflect the status such as ""calling""",18,1,1,0
Why are there yellow and orange intermixed dates? I would expect them to be clumped together by color,18,1,1,0
ps im happy to provide feedback about the prototype itself in case we didnt talk well enough in studio,19,0,0,0

good ideas but there could be many alternatives that already exist try to think how your offering is novel,19,1,1,1
it seems like the firebase code is working for the account info but not necessarily for the projects aspect,19,1,1,0
finally think about why users would participate to help in the first place what is the incentive for them,19,1,1,1
think about how to align the idea with a need that is silently unfulfilled to make it more compelling,19,1,1,1
be sure to write your name and pid on the top right corner of your assignment the next time,19,1,1,0

the captions clearly explain the tools that the subjects used but it doesnt mention the breakdowns that they faced,19,1,0,1
it is unclear how to add a teammate or the specific instructions for what to do on the mission,19,1,0,0
is there no confirmation for the items ive collected whats the connection between this game and the real world,19,1,1,0
also think about what gets lost once we digitally transfer the overall experience of exchanging contact information or resumes,19,1,1,0
there should be pictures for every subject but ill give you the point since it was not specified explicitly,19,1,1,1
1 point of extra credit awarded for efforts in getting your gameplay to work good job with using d3,19,1,0,1
would there be a way to further extrapolate this statement and connecting it to peoples internal triggers ie feelings,19,1,1,0
confusing names in cloud watched vs done watched buttons but more importantly i couldnt find which one does what,19,1,0,1
the account page is isolated cant go back to it also i cant scroll on the create recipe page,19,1,1,0
i dont really see how this is connected to the specific pov point given for connecting with a storyboard,19,1,0,0
i liked how you went into detail about the breakdowns of each person you observed great job at needfinding,19,1,0,0
the button styling does not appear to be consistent if you end up using the red add task button,19,1,1,0
i need to see your code on github also please disable the login functionality completely it is entirely unnecessary,19,1,1,1
your second sentence is a bit too descriptive in that you tell the user to click a specific icon,19,1,0,1
i like the importance rating system instead of stars i would maybe opt for colors red severe green casual,19,1,1,0
the view ingredients button on all meal components seem unnecessary in most of the cases ingredients are all viewable,19,1,1,1
please do not provide external links as far as possible and do not modify them its tedious to check,19,1,1,1
i do not know what you are using as json or do you have a database please specifiy this,19,1,1,1
good this is less taboo due to multifaceted point of view still try to move more toward unexplored domains,19,1,1,1
some of the functionality is unclear what else can the app do besides have the user input dog info,19,1,1,1
Also maybe adding some feedback system from the crowd? Like a upvote/downvote feature to get some feedback from audience?,19,1,1,1
Good use of broad domains as well as some that are a little more specific to find lead users.,19,1,0,1
How does the controller tie into the yard scale interface? What separates the yard control from the foot control?,19,1,1,1
I like how it predicts your actions and suggests in real time what commands the user should use instead.,19,1,0,0
I like that your hack only has one page and it's color coded but it is not very organized.,19,1,0,0
"I like the visual design and layout, I think you really hit on the feedback you got last class",19,1,0,0
"I think there are too many colors, you could take away the red and the interface would do fine",19,1,1,0
I wish the empty spaces were completely used. Make the interface full screen instead of half of the screen.,19,1,1,0
"I'm a little confused, are the 2 different interfaces or they are just one but very smart interface ?",19,1,0,1
"Not sure what the rectangles on the side are supposed to represent, maybe this space could be used better",19,1,1,0
Overall the design is very clean and I think it will be useful to people who want to donate!,19,1,0,0
The red on dark blue is a little jarring. Have you tried to experiment with different hues of red?,19,1,1,1
This is very cool! How long will the arrows stay on the screen? What if it blocks something importan?,19,1,0,1
"Very interesting concept! I really like it, but I feel like you could flesh it out a bit more!",19,1,1,0
What is the difference between the foot and the yard scales? They seem to both fulfill the same purpose,19,1,0,1
Who is the emergency contact? I think the name should be displayed so you know exactly who you're calling,19,1,1,1
"You identify a problem that common users have, but I'm not sure your solution is for a lead user.",19,1,0,0
i dont see where youve described a specific instance where there is friction in the collaborative process in this report,20,1,0,0
another improvement in presentation would be to show actual classes and topics instead of placeholders and explain the structure separately,20,1,1,1
as discussed making a chrome extension is unchartered territory for this course which comes with its own set of risks,20,1,0,1
not seeing you use json data anywhere if you are post on piazza to get point back point added 12112016,20,1,1,0
its good that youve justified how heuristics will be adhered to but something also worth mentioning is the actual criticism,20,1,1,0
i can see the value of the current textual list interface but some interesting visualization to attract users wouldnt hurt,20,1,1,1
you might want to conduct comparative analysis on existing apps while focusing on how your app is distinctive from others,20,1,1,1
important interface elements are potentially ignored here such as reordering activities if that makes sense and links to auxiliary pagesfunctionality,20,1,1,1
the pictures that are still broken and some of the functionaly that does not work can be interpreted as error,20,1,0,0
storyboards should state an issue and also introduce an interface the storyboards should show how that interface solved the issue,20,1,1,0
think about how to align the idea with a need that is unfulfilled because people remain in their comfort zones,20,1,1,1
its difficult to draw a conclusion from the analysis because of the use of noncategorical data in the chisquared test,20,1,0,1
great job finishing the interaction flow rewarded one extra point for implementing the search function adding comments and upvote downvote,20,1,0,1
extra point for database integration at this early stage try to focus on deep interactions rather than simply technical details,20,1,1,1
they are very very similar ill give you the point though since the app itself is differing with each storyboard,20,1,0,1
the core problem the pov conveys is vague and is weakly connected to the specifics found from the need statements,20,1,0,1
user needs must be expressed in a selfexplanatory manner for example 7 is vague without the context known from observations,20,1,1,1
points given for going above and beyond with using a database and styling the app smooth animations and not buggy,20,1,0,1
2how long does the user have to wait for a response is the app really helpful if no one responds,20,1,0,1
be careful about distribution of work make sure to input any potential schedule conflicts ie midterms out of town etc,20,1,1,0
you dont have to mention the names of the specific people when writing about user needs they are generic statements,20,1,0,1
i noticed you have a lot of html pages i wonder if rendering your json through handlebars might be easier,20,1,1,0
this is a bit oversimplified work with users to see what they would expect to do for such an app,20,1,1,1
storyboard 1 if someone were to pick up this storyboard they would not know how to create a distinct prototype,20,1,0,0
try having greater focus on violations it appears you tried to balance the two which is okay but not expectednecessary,20,1,1,0
after getting navigated to the mbti test page theres no control to go back check out the video below httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv6nisr7snkm,20,1,1,0
also try to ensure it works online maybe try a private video on youtube its likely a file format issue,20,,,
its not working well but ill go easy on you guys you have a hard technical challenge in this design,20,,,
"I like how the app provides cool sight seeing spots on the users route, this heightens the overall travel experience",20,,,
I like the different modules that a person can add or delete based on the type of trip they're planning.,20,,,
I question how often people search while taking notes? I get it if its after they're done and reviewing notes.,20,,,
I really like these icons. But these icons might be too small to easily see on a watch size display.,20,,,
"I think this is a pretty good idea, there are lots of people who have trouble keeping track job apps.",20,,,
"I wish the weather display is bigger, and maybe add a line chart for visualizing the data might be useful.",20,,,
I would like to see a typographic difference between the recruiter name and position. Maybe use bold for the name?,20,,,
"If your persona already knows people in the class, couldn't he just catch up on material outside of class time?",20,,,
interface is well-thought out - lots of edge cases seem to be addressed / UI flow is smooth and uniform,20,,,
It is interesting and helpful to use artificial intelligence to recognize the picture the users upload and auto-fill the form.,20,,,
It looks really cool. I wish there is a video showing what's going on and how you interact with it,20,,,
"Really like the auto-set alarm feature, but I wish I have freedom to turn off auto-set alarm on certain event",20,,,
Text should be white or show high contrast if it's a clickable button! Faded text indicates that it is disabled,20,,,
Theres been a lot of progress on the design. I think that the simplicity and interactions are better flushed out.,20,,,
Very nice use of AR! I feel like there's a lot of possibilities here that you could explore more in-depth.,20,,,
What exactly are these balls for? I'm a bit confused as to how they contribute to the overall interface here.,20,,,
please see feedback on the dev plan from the previous assignment and no need to include the plan for past weeks,21,0,1,0
while your submission has points about the major problems with both the prototypes it lacks meaningful thoughts about the heuristic evaluations,21,1,0,0
visual elements such as headers look inconsistent profile page input fields dont have outlines or is it just on my machine,21,1,0,0
the storyboards are fine but you can do quite a bit with google maps think about how you can be different,21,,,
although its polished than before i think theres still a fair amount of room to enhance the apps usability and interactivity,21,,,
because these students are your potential users perhaps make your application more positive or add a component that reigns in positivity,21,,,
one good way to get more usable feedback is by observing users try out the app and noting hiccups they face,21,,,
a few of your user needs are a bit repetitive i would encourage you to delve deeper into the user needs,21,,,
as a suggestion the photos would look better if shown from a 90 degree angle to the plane of the paper,21,,,
im concerned about your first 2 ideas they dont really offer a unique solution i like the 3rd one the best,21,,,
pov doesnt describe the reasons why users have difficulty being motivated in exercising a pov statement should not contain solution statements,21,,,
you might want to conduct some comparative analysis on other matchmaking or dating platforms and see how yours can stand out,21,,,
would liked to have seen a more explicit mention of how the topic might be influenced by games with a purpose,21,,,
many needs are similar or already have solutions which your subjects arent using it might be useful to find out why,21,,,
i agree that having visualization could help people motivate but without stating why this pov fails to focus on user needs,21,,,
borderline taboo good pov though focus more on procrastination as a psychologicalemotional issue than a productivity issue and youll be good,21,,,
if you go to httpscse170projectherokuappcomcustomerordersummary and then hit the back button it fails to load the resources from the json file,21,,,
good work here you could try matching any word rather than just the beginning to further improve the user experience user,21,,,
i wish there was a voice over or captions to explain what exactly was happening because the background noises were distracting,21,,,
plz remove login credential requirement there could be more functionality its not really clear what hearts mean when displaying mood data,21,,,
not there yet youre not working much with the data focus more on quantitative data or quantify your qualitative data somehow,21,,,
hard to see prototype well in pictures its unclear if the user plays these mini games while actually cooking or not,21,,,
focus less on the login page and user set up and more on the actual navigation and interactions within the app,21,,,
when the add amount modal view is up there is no way to dismiss it check out the video below httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtcerzufjr7m,21,,,
Directions could be overlayed on the map to give a more specific spatial mapping of what to do and conserve space,21,,,
"For a mobile interface, the buttons seem a bit hard to press, especially for people with larger fingers (like me, LOL).",21,,,
"For the visual design, the background on the right is a little dark. Probably use a lighter gray would be better",21,,,
Great feature! But I am not sure whether the user will remember to use this feature in a really intense moment?,21,,,
I like how not cluttered this inteface is but I wonder if you can put anything on the space on top.,21,,,
"I like how you have incorporated different colors for the different modes, which makes it easy to distinguish one from another.",21,,,
I like that there are prereqs but I wish that there were more information about the classes such as the professor.,21,,,
I think it is useful to sort by expiration and quantity and but I wish that there was higher information density.,21,,,
I think your name and expiration date boxes need to be larger. There is no reason why they are so small?,21,,,
I wish the outline section on the right could be truncated to just show title (that user can expand if needed),21,,,
I wish you can show more edge cases and come up with a realistic and super concise example in the video.,21,,,
I would want to choose how long to wait and see how much it would cost for different durations of time,21,,,
I would want to see the times of all the events I've favorited here and the corresponding locations on the map.,21,,,
"I'm confused about the ""I'm a passenger"" button and the 2 next to it. What happens when you click on it?",21,,,
"If the user can disable force shut down, then can't they play the game all night and never go to bed?",21,,,
"If this is an app, I believe it is better to automatically scan the environment when the users open the app.",21,,,
It looks like it would be useful for an video game artist. Color might be nice to have in future prototypes!,21,,,
It would be nice to link to the recruiters linkedin page or portfolio so you can get more information on them,21,,,
"It's pretty simple, but overall I feel like with a bit more fleshing out it could yield some very interesting results.",21,,,
"It's unclear what the ""Approximate time"" means. Maybe it should be ""Approximate time until normal pricing"" or something of that sort",21,,,
Looks like a very functional layout and I like how specific it is for solving the task of planning a hackothon.,21,,,
"Overall the design makes sense, except for the user picture. I don't see how it's related to getting an item made",21,,,
The content on the first screens is a little unclear of what it means and how exactly to interact with it.,21,,,
"Varying text sizes could be used to emphasize the importance of certain info (ex: ""Interviewer"" could be smaller than ""Thomas Johnson"")",21,,,
make sure that these are incorporated in the development plan also note the rubric for a8 especially to fix any aesthetic details,22,1,1,0
if im missing something that you think is definitely worthy of consideration feel free to let me know in the last studio,22,0,0,0
this just shows the situation and hints at a need a good storyboard covers all the three ses situation sequence and satisfaction,22,,,
how does one create different types of workouts a lot else can possibly be thought of in terms of interactions and features,22,,,
pictures relate well with your observations but try to make them understandable independently the words made up for the captions this time,22,,,
focus on what the interaction achieves for the user rather than the tasks that they are able to do on the app,22,,,
try not to mention all relatedsimilar interactions but to get to the most important ones so that your point is communicated well,22,,,
it will be hard to determine which is more effective so just stick with one change such as the text being different,22,,,
i like how patients can search for articles and scientists easily is there a way for them to savebookmark articles they liked,22,,,
you did mention a possible outcome but all outcomes should be taken into account ie both a null and experimental hypothesis result,22,,,
2 extra credit point for going above and styling the pages and having smooth interactions that are not buggy and fullyfleshed out,22,,,
too much focus on the solution you already have ideas of features you want to implement which will limit your design space,22,,,
i had a group do something very similar last year so the idea be careful of turning this into another timer app,22,,,
interesting but how do you differentiate this from other trivia apps or how can you make this more than a trivia app,22,,,
remember to specify who will be taking care of which task even if you will both be working on the same task,22,,,
good job at needfinding your observations could have dug deeper into the breakdowns that the subjects encountered while they were note taking,22,,,
very sparse and too directly guiding the user plan to ask more questions and gather more input on the brief and debrief,22,,,
"For security, in the all-in-one view, maybe it can just show a feed directly, and then allow quick toggle through each feed.",22,,,
However I am still confused with the recipes thing because I don't really know what functions the app can serve me here,22,,,
I believe the camera button should be more obvious. You can put it on the top since it is an important feature.,22,,,
I don't really know how can you rotate the Yard size display since it is supposed to be on a public display,22,,,
"I like the visual design, it is simple and since it is specifically made to be cheap, cardboard is the logical approach.",22,,,
I like your idea of organizing Application for different companies so as to help people not to miss the company application deadline,22,,,
I think quantity is important because having a lot of vegetables is more of a problem than having a few vegetables left.,22,,,
I wish the pictures had text labels for clarity. I like how the days and colors show the urgency of food expiration.,22,,,
I'm not sure how useful temperature is? I really like the seeing pictures of what the inside of the room is though.,22,,,
"If I want to replace the lightbulb, I'd also want to know where to get one and what is a reasonable price.",22,,,
Inch: I like the relevant info that is easily viewable. The text seems a bit small though for such a small screen.,22,,,
It would be nice to see travel time totals instead or in addition to how much longer each choice will take you,22,,,
providing a diet via an apple watch may be difficult. Its hard to fit much text on the screen and stay readable,22,,,
Some function seems counter intuitive like listening through microphone for surrounding dangers but putting on earphones might hinder ability to recognize danger.,22,,,
"Some screens on the watch view is good. Like the weather. Others seems to be displaying too much, like the clock toggles.",22,,,
The floor buttons would be hard to click on a watch screen. Maybe just have one button/interface to reserve any open room?,22,,,
"The user case could be confusing, The added flow chart looks good though, It helps clear up possible confusion of the scenario.",22,,,
This is extemerly specifc. Well Done ! I'm looking at the interface and i'm able to understand the function of this product.,22,,,
good job its an interesting app with fine design hope youve had some fun this quarter in studio ps consider taking cogs 121,23,0,0,0
unfortunately i dont get what this app is about and it seems too similar to the previous prototype lets talk about this sometime,23,,,
while the description is good i need your perspective on how the activity falls under the umbrella of shaking up the status quo,23,,,
observations are quite good but there should have been emphasis on analyzing if things are going well or if not the issues faced,23,,,
creative idea i have not seen any applications like this i think it builds a necessary bridge between researchers and students and patients,23,,,
ok but reframe it so that it addresses the need for potential citizen scientists to be able to actually find citizen science platforms,23,,,
some of these needs not explicitly from the breakdowns and observations mentioned but point awarded because you hit most of the points well,23,,,
good work with the timers the interaction works well hence an extra point make sure to use json data in your app though,23,,,
i wish i was able to clearly see the features of the interface the angle of the video made it hard to see,23,,,
explanation of outcome of ab testing could be more in depth maybe explain what your null hypothesis is and significant differenceno significant difference,23,,,
photos focused too much on the interface of the sites rather than showing the users reaction or showing the user within these interactions,23,,,
sketches are not what we expected but interesting nonetheless and just crossed the threshold for a correct for the purposes of the rubric,23,,,
interesting idea be careful of thinking of potential gametypes as those are more solutions and right now were just focusing on the needs,23,,,
no github link provided in assignment submission but i pulled it from previous assignments remember to include a link to your github repo,23,,,
because of the diversity of your observation in different activities i think your need proposal is very interesting and full of design opportunities,23,,,
the home button is somewhat redundant why not have the app name at the top serve as the link as is usually expected,23,,,
there were a few pages that did not seem to show a separate page modalnamely the password and register in the login page,23,,,
im not sure how storyboard 2 and 3 relates to pov as there seems to be no component regarding the users personality representation,23,,,
i think the topic you chose is very interesting and unique but the aspect of using mobile games doesnt seem to be related,23,,,
"Always make your field big if its something the user will click. In the last picture, they're very small and easy to miss.",23,,,
Building a order using public wall size display might not be a best choice - a personalized tablet will compelet this really well.,23,,,
"cancel is a secondary action. it should have less visual weight than ""on my way!"" We don't want users to click on it!",23,,,
Great simple layout and dsign. You show all of the important things that need to be present in an easy to interpret layout.,23,,,
I like how i can add artwork to my collections. i wish there is more interaction with another user for the yard display.,23,,,
"I like the minimal interface, I don't think the user needs to see a ton of information so keeping it simple is ideal.",23,,,
I think the interface is really well orgnaized and does not include many of the confusing features that so many text editors include.,23,,,
I think your function does explains itself and the scenario is valid and good. But is it safe to check watch when snowboarding???,23,,,
I wish the map on the yard screen is more visible. I like how the inch display can guide me to specific artwork.,23,,,
"I'm a little confused, is it a 2 way call? Or just a recording of the audio, which the emergency contact can hear?",23,,,
"I'm not sure, but it looks like location is entered rather than detected which would be hard to do on a smart watch.",23,,,
"Initially, it's unclear to me what the ""check"" button means. What is the user checking? You can be more specific in your labels.",23,,,
It is better to consider the problem that the white words are diffcult to read with grey background for the foot scale interface.,23,,,
Not sure how often rooms are actually available on an immediate basis. But I guess for the design we can assume they are??,23,,,
Would like to see the real prototype using digital design. Some online real time assistant or option of uploading pictures would be better,23,,,
satisfaction is muddled up as the need is to not get distracted but the character is shown happy when he gets to browse fb,24,,,
your descriptions are very short and vague they need to be detailed i dont see any sort of clear engagement with the user either,24,,,
it might be useful to emphasize through the test the importance of collaborating with your garden members to maintain the quality of your garden,24,,,
point of view should be a single concise statement that captures the needs of all users rather than explaining the need for each user,24,,,
there is no description of unique interactions in addition these interactions are not unique to this app and are found in most budgeting apps,24,,,
there is scope to have the activity log do more than merely show the history ie how would users want to learn from it,24,,,
overall some interesting ideas for a unique topic it will be interesting to see how you explore translating this digital game with the realworld,24,,,
i recommend you only change one of the options to checkboxes rather than the whole page it will be easier to test this way,24,,,
saving a workout takes you back to the home page which is unexpected also editing inputs with a keyboard is not the best idea,24,,,
the check boxes could have side effects such as moving those suggestions down or highlighting them differently to make it more apparent to users,24,,,
feel free to use a plan that actually works for you this is not for us but to help your group work things out,24,,,
"actually, maybe your system can be starter and it can automatically choose the correct mode for certain environment. You can set it as default.",24,,,
Hey there ! Great work. I have trouble opening the LFG tool. I'm not sure if this is on my part or the critiquekit.,24,,,
I like how the interface takes the trouble of subdividing body areas out of the user's hands and guides them towards finding more workouts,24,,,
"I like the interface design for the interface. I wish I can ""bookmark""/""save"" some common settings for the lighting to get some quick access.",24,,,
I pretty much like your idea. But the interface for multiple windows does not quite look good. Why are those screens tweaked like that?,24,,,
"I think if you're including seat # information, your persona would appreciate seats taken, and a visual representation of where there are available seats.",24,,,
"I think that you did great needfinding but I wish I could see more design in your prototype, like what's holding the tablet up.",24,,,
I'm confused as to how this is a lead user solution. Does evreyone face this issue and how does your user hack the problem?,24,,,
"In the foot face. I think there should be a price shown under the Recommended Products, rather than after I click on the ""compare"".",24,,,
"Inch scale - buttons, elements, and text are all far too small. Consider reducing the task able to be completed on the inch scale.",24,,,
Initially it's hard to break into because it's a lot going on. I think that the type of noises are good in different colors.,24,,,
"It would be nice, if this text didnt protrude into the chart section and was onlu restricted to left of the thick grey line",24,,,
"Probabaly you can add more information about the event that relative to transportation, for example, the location of the event, the distance and etc.",24,,,
The task seems quite vague - come up with a concrete scenario in which the UI is driven by the lead user's specific need,24,,,
This looks really good! I'm not certain how useful the I'm feeling lucky feature is and I don't think people care about past reservations.,24,,,
Unable to access the PDF -- I've tried contacting the user and getting permission to access the file. Will update once I get access.,24,,,
"When someone is new to football game, it is better to clear the meaning of numbers for the yard scale interface on the top.",24,,,
YARD SCALE 1) I like how the app displays deals based on the user's life. This adds a sense of personalization to the app.,24,,,
what about when the user clicks outside the input field and then clicks back make sure not to count erroneously and use the appropriate test,25,1,1,0
some unique features stated seemed to be visible but not implemented such as allowing users to sign nda disclosure scientist receiving funds and filtering projects,25,,,
you ought to have included more of the calculations as shown in the slides rather than just a line of calculation which i cant understand,25,,,
calendar page is secondary functionality pick more data visualizations to wizard of oz but implement the capacity to collect the data that would drive them,25,,,
there should be one single point of view that captures the needs for all your users rather than a point of view for each person,25,,,
point of view should be a concise statement that captures a single reason for all users point awarded because i think you caught the sentiment,25,,,
when i complete a task and then refresh the page the tasks i completed reappear and the number of tasks left to complete never changes,25,,,
the instructions should better emphasize the personal food and mood tracking aspect the instructions still make it seem like the pet is of more importance,25,,,
would inputting a specific mbti type will terminally remove all other people of incompatible types what if users still would like to see other people,25,,,
your app works perfectly well with no errors and also has some nice interactions youd have gotten more extracredit points had you implemented more interactions,25,,,
interesting pov focused on the logging data inputting aspect of your daily diet and activity i look forward to seeing how the project would evolve,25,,,
some of the needs are very similar it would have been interesting to consider different types of job seekers to get varied and distinct needs,25,,,
not sure if your latest changes were pushed because much of the functionality you mentioned completing in your development plan was not in the app,25,,,
point awarded but the tasks should be centered around the different assignments weektoweek so you can ensure that you meet all rubric and assignment requirements,25,,,
it isnt clear for which of your users you have written notes for you need to write a separate set of notes for each one,25,,,
the changes are more appropriately filling in gaps in the previously incomplete prototype that is not the intent as heuristic violations are not being rectified,25,,,
oh i see the map now make it more easily accessible im hesitant to give this point because it still feels like its missing something,25,,,
your app is beautifully designed and the core functionality appears to be implemented for the most part moreover the interaction appears to be almost seamless,25,,,
"Custom modifications to mechanical keyboards beyond keycap replacement certainly fall under the domain of ""lead users"", I'm curious to see how your design turns out.",25,,,
"Generally, I think of clicking as trying to see more details not add. You may want a separate ""+"" button for adding to your schedule",25,,,
Hmm. While this makes sense...I think the text is getting lighter too quickly. If anything I think maybe making the size smaller makes more sense.,25,,,
How does a percentage tell the user how their posture is suffering? Seems to not be a very direct or even accurate measure of posture,25,,,
"I didn't think the dot, dash, and box intuitively represents stressful activities, comments, and relaxing activities. Maybe you could look at icons that fit better?",25,,,
"I don't quite like your font type. And although the digit is large enough to say, I can barely see the little text underneath it.",25,,,
I like how different keys on the keyboard contain different types of switches - allowing for alternative types of feedback based on the key hit.,25,,,
I like how it shows the price per time. I also really like how it shows the different parking spots and how far it is.,25,,,
I like how useful this design is to your user but I wish that there were more functionality shown in the prototype with the screens.,25,,,
I like the simiplicity and organization of the app. I wish there was more space for the key topic and less for the other resources.,25,,,
I like your idea of demoing human body in the public display that makes it clear to see which part of body is going well,25,,,
"I like your scenario. I thought you decided no longer doing the Tijuana thing though, nice to see you coming back to your original design",25,,,
I really like your idea. Maybe there is a way to add in a better gauge of if the user is hitting the marks correctly.,25,,,
I think that the foot scale could be better explained in your persona. Would it be used only before? or during the massage as well?,25,,,
"INCH SCALE 1) Instead of having text on the 2nd screen, maybe you could use voice output to guide the user throughout his shopping route.",25,,,
"It would be nice to know the model and color of the car, kind of like Uber. So you know which is the right car",25,,,
Overall I really like the idea. Consider that ther could be a bigger difference between the yard and inch functionality. Be creative on the yard!,25,,,
Really like the design! I wish the app can have a tracking feature showing a visualization of my time distribution and my progress on sleeping.,25,,,
"Try changing the buttons on the yard scale. I think they mock real life too much, but will be hard to control in that way.",25,,,
not a real interpretation you need to provide an explanation as to why the test turned out the way it did even if it isnt correct,26,1,1,0
a prototype is complete in itself it is not any particular page as a result i have to dock points for the second prototype entirely unfortunately,26,0,0,1
appears to be incomplete try to see how you could help the persona with an app if possible and indicate the result that makes her happy,26,,,
take a more insightful stance this one just cuts it as there is some direction to guide decisions also storyboards dont focus on the motivation part,26,,,
the rubric mentions describing a core problem without offering a solution your pov has a set of possible solutions reviews of dining hall food splitting receipts,26,,,
its unclear whether i have done the task correctly is this just adding a task also is there a way to assign tasks to specific people,26,,,
i wish the pov contained a little more context as to what it is about keeping the memories that is currently missing from the observed users,26,,,
your user needs are a bit too specific it would help to generalize the need a slight bit so that you may address a bigger audience,26,,,
great job finishing most of the features rewarded two point for implementing the tag filtering feature as well as the time measurement and animation in checkpoints,26,,,
the interactions that you mention are not implemented how would you facilitate communication a chat system how would you handle money logistics including a base price,26,,,
it would have been great if the pov contained some explanation as to what specifically is the implication of having different attitudes towards using these apps,26,,,
because you are using an outside library please put in comments with keywords like json so that i can see where your data io functionality is,26,,,
after checking your development plan i decided not to award your team the point because there were no changes or additional tasks in the new version,26,,,
i wish there was some way for the app to know where i am how did the app know that gobind needed a seat in geisel,26,,,
i like the side navigation i suggest researching if the order should be changed perhaps by importance is chatting more important than chores in your app,26,,,
analyzing other existing banking apps might provide some insights to latent design opportunities but i think graphically associating spending with some memory is an interesting idea,26,,,
navigation feels tedious due to the hamburger menu since these arent pages one would go to infrequently and instead seem to be important to the app,26,,,
Adding a social feature to the spp such as leaderboard might also be useful. Peer pressure and gamification can improve motivation of keep using the app.,26,,,
How come the tablet would know user's current posture? It might be better to be tutorial site that teaches how to relax body (like yoga instructions..),26,,,
I dont belive the sound output from a watch would be sufficient to notify surrounding people. Emitting it from a different source would be more effective,26,,,
I like the map function and seeing all the attractions and different hostels at once. I would imagine it might be difficult once outliers are introduced.,26,,,
I like the organization and I wonder if there is anything skeumorphic that you can do with this interface where you have more icons of food.,26,,,
I think it is hard to put four buttons in the same screen on smart watch and users may eaily press the wrong button by mistake.,26,,,
I think there is a lot of potential for needs here. Let's think about what kind of need that lead users of this product could use,26,,,
"I wish I can receive voice feedback for the popup issues -- in some cases, user might not be able to directly look at the display",26,,,
"I wish there are more ways to interact with the screen. And as said in class, the seating area colors needs to be decided more carefully.",26,,,
I wish you can put the introduction of the app in the login page and you do not need the about button at the top bar.,26,,,
"If comments, likes, etc. are important to this user then your design would possibly make these features clear visually appealing to the user reading the article.",26,,,
It would be fun to also include some different sort methods such as by 'items rarely used' since your lead user expressed concerns about forgetting items.,26,,,
Really like this task control interface - consider to add more contrast to the icon? Read on grey might not be clear enough on certain backgrounds?,26,,,
"Since all the player is doing is adding or subtracting numbers to their score, perhaps using a different functionality would be more intuitive (e.g., slide right/left).",26,,,
"This idea is pretty cool - I've seen it implemented in games such as Fallout 4, which contain extensive lists of items across many different categories.",26,,,
Very handy! Maybe you could design an app that scans in the receipt and makes a list of items bought and displays it on the fridge?,26,,,
Yard: I like that it takes into account the person's profile since that's definitely a struggle with finding guests if there are many of them waiting.,26,,,
apart from the main idea in the storyboard to make sense of job emails there is a lot that can be done to make a complete app,27,1,0,0
i am unable to create a project view my created projects moreover the projects articles in the home page do not appear to link to separate pages,27,,,
please make sure to select the right pages from the pdf that correspond to the question i have fixed it to show what we would usually expect,27,,,
ps looking at your live page it seems that you intended to offer activity choices solid bullet points are not a clear lowfi representation of radio buttons,27,,,
the profile page says training topic so im confused as to what the exact purpose of this page is does this fit under the training tab instead,27,,,
i wish the login pagesplash page had a statement that explains the goal of your app healthnet can be about anything for example linkedin connect to opportunity,27,,,
i think your idea fits the theme well and i think you did a good job taking note of the breakdowns and successes that your interviewees encountered,27,,,
the app is functional with no dead ends and it has clearcut features the app seems simple enough to learn and use which is a great thing,27,,,
the needs should be based on the user not the system ill give you the point but you should be thinking from more from the user perspective,27,,,
a list format for these changes would not only make it easier to read but would provide you with an overview of how to prioritize these changes,27,,,
i can see what you wrote came from your observations but they are not really needs ill still give you the point since it is close enough,27,,,
points 345 are the same but in a differing context all of them are i wish i could get reviews of x by people whove used x,27,,,
i believe user profile view isnt completely functional the redo task button or clicking the add button on the homepage doesnt change anything on the profile page,27,,,
Add the location information in the inch interface because watch will vibrate when user gets close to certain dining hall. The location info matters at this time.,27,,,
And I am not sure what Lead User's creative part is. It looks like sending message is a thing that most people would do in that situtation.,27,,,
"Being about to find area without surge can definitely be a good idea. However, the idea need to employ more design thinking to make it more helpful.",27,,,
Foot: I like that you can see the relevant info right away (number and time remaining)! It's great that you can see the menu as you're waiting.,27,,,
"For the transcript section, I would like to automatically have dates and 'important information' highlighted and possibly moved to a new location within the note taking app.",27,,,
Great job in providing a digest of the tasks for the next day. This does a good job of putting ones schedule in context of their todo's,27,,,
How does it calculate what time to sleep based on previous patterns? If you've slept few hours does it try to compensate by having you sleep more?,27,,,
"I like the design in the shoe, it is very creative. I think that the skethes could be a little more clear in order to show more.",27,,,
I like the functionality because I find it hard to take notes. I wish that it could drag snippets from the links into under the key topic.,27,,,
I really like the idea - in what way are the grocery lists synchronized with the app? via receipt or some sort of other itemized store list?,27,,,
I wish you can put the search bar and the overview on top of the side bar since they are the most frequently elements to look at.,27,,,
I wonder if a map would be hard to read. Maybe it would be better to display zones/aisles? or just the instructions of Go Forward 3 minutes.,27,,,
If your intention is to reserve a room I don't see the option to do that here. Unless this is time remaining on the room you have?,27,,,
"Inch interface is too much for an iWatch interface. I recommend giving it one function only, or putting these features into a widget instead of an iwatch.",27,,,
"Love your idea !! It would be nice to see some interface on the board. For example: maybe put some settings on their, snapshot, things like that.",27,,,
Probably make use of the haptic feedback and that can be a huge user experience improvement and reduce the problem of looking at the watch while snowboarding,27,,,
"Visually the design is very clean but I do think it is hard to read the orange font on a white background, especially at a far distance",27,,,
1 point penalty for late submission it was after 2 am i can consider the 107 am submission to be on time but looks like it wasnt complete,28,0,0,1
good job in filling the functionality gap over the past few weeks but i think theres still some potential to improve the aesthetics and interaction of the app,28,,,
it might be useful to have interview questions at the end of your test so you can gather good insights about what your user thought about your app,28,,,
the idea of visualizing the progress of saving money is novel there might be a way to make it more distinctive and thus letting your app stand out,28,,,
it didnt seem like there was a clear solution at the end of the storyboard because the user was still ignoring the timer again avoid making a timer,28,,,
there are tad bits that can be enhanced for example there is a downward arrow in the my tasks page which is hard to know the functionality of,28,,,
conveying emotions in artifacts photos videos text is a very interesting design space good job but the link between your observation to the need statements is somewhat weak,28,,,
the design of the activity is interesting but its exploration connected to the pov is limited what other pain points scenarios do people have in managing their finances,28,,,
because your app assumes the existence of two smart watches i think it would have been great if you could include interaction through them as well while testing,28,,,
lots of confusion and misunderstanding observed from the users its a good time to think about how the app is structured around user scenarios and redesign if necessary,28,,,
"FOOT SCALE 1) You should include an ""Other"" tab on the top because every grocery store sells different items. This tab could cover snacks, alcohol, baked goods, etc..",28,,,
Foot: I like the status bar but I think it is somewhat visually unappealing and you may want to change it to a color gradient across the bar.,28,,,
I like the idea of a visual overlay for instruction - its quite similar to the production effects that a sports network would do during a replay analysis,28,,,
I like the interface but why doesn't the video mode go to full screen and what is the purpose of the grey background taking up so much space?,28,,,
I like the simplicity of the watch app. I'm not sure why the user would need to see their HR though esp if they're trying to fall asleep.,28,,,
"I like your attempt at making the product more hygenic, that's is aboslutely an issue as more and more people use the product so identifying that is big.",28,,,
I wish it is more high resolution and true to scale. I don't know if it's just like this on my laptop or is it just like this.,28,,,
I'm a little confused as to why Google Maps is her hack. Unless she takes the information from Hostels/Facebook/Yelp and then use Google maps to cross-reference her choices.,28,,,
"If the app's main goal is to help gamers get enough sleep, then maybe the app could set up a recommended alarm clock time to wake up to?",28,,,
"If you were to create an app, you could display the items using a grid. To add, you could also highlight the uncommon items, like on the receipt.",28,,,
"Inch scale - I like the simple, minimalist design--however, is the temperature a necessary statistic to display when dealing with light energy savings? Consider removing for more space",28,,,
"Make sure to clean up the minor textual errors for Tuesday (You have second floor twice in the yard design), and Muir College Apt might be too vague",28,,,
"Really good set up of problem, however, I believe for this asignment we were supposed to identify a lead user who has already come up with a solution.",28,,,
Showing how the different sections compete for who is able to start the wave is a little unclear and I am not sure if it would really work.,28,,,
Tag transcript sounds really good! Like having a way to know what time in the lecture you need to recheck later makes a lot of sense to me.,28,,,
"Voice is a good way as a input in inch size. However, it should be more intuitive to tell users what users can say to control the system.",28,,,
please plan one week in advance so that progress can be compared also include development tasks other than those strictly required by the assignment such as any bugs fixed,29,,,
take a more concrete stance this one gives a little insight but no direction also the jump from necessary belongings to whattowear can be considered fairly arbitrary without justification,29,,,
someone else cant come up with a distinct prototype from with the pov just from looking at the storyboard if the storyboard itself contains the working of the prototype,29,,,
there is scope to make it much better given how rich your observations are think deeper and dont let your personal bias if any guide the point of view,29,,,
try to phrase needs in a more general manner even though they should relate to your observations they shouldnt specifically talk about those or the subjects esp by name,29,,,
on a different note how would you handle the case when the app cannot suggest a group immediately maybe because not many people have signed up for one yet,29,,,
the point of view doesnt seem to capture the real reason of why people are not good at cooking why do they not already understand their kitchen and tools,29,,,
i think you should focus on the fact that there is greater contextual information that is constantly changing as i think that is the unique value of your app,29,,,
i like how patients can sign in as a guest it is unclear if a scientist or investor can sign in as a guest should they be able to,29,,,
some of these are featurelike and hence sound like solutions such as enroll in one click what you probably mean is that it should be an intuitive simple process,29,,,
im sure youve realized by now but you are leaning towards treating the user like a subject also productivity apps are overdone so you need to keep distinguishing yourself,29,,,
most of these needs were to focused on the tools used for navigation or physical features should focus instead on user confusion or how they react to confusing directions,29,,,
while its fully functional im certain your team can actually implement the feature of tracking a persons movement along the routes without that your app is only half baked,29,,,
the skill of playing a game outside of cooking does not translate to actually cooking how can you bridge this gap more how can you augment the cooking experience,29,,,
i would just do one of the 2 options so that you can guarantee that your results are based off of one change rather than a multitude of factors,29,,,
i felt bad to deduct another point here for the same reason as the last week but you were supposed to include both weeks development plans side by side,29,,,
the race idea is creative but this still relies heavily on a timer component a more interesting area is how can we encourage productivity without the use of timing,29,,,
prototype doesnt seem to show full interactions also from this overview it just seems like an app to input budget info what makes this different from things like mint,29,,,
for anything that is only to be submitted trial watermarks are just fine however if it has to be presented try to use other free tools that arent noticeable,29,,,
its good that youre taking inspiration from strava but be careful not to make an app too similar to strava what can you do instead to set yourself apart,29,,,
i wish the app had a visible timer you can test if a visible timer that counts up or down motivates people to stay focused on their assigned task,29,,,
"2) On the 4th screen of the inch scale, what happens if bars or tables are not available? Would the interface only display one of the options? or both?",29,,,
"As the final presentation, you can include the screen of presentation, which allow users to go through the video when they are taking note without going to another page.",29,,,
"Especially at the inch scale, I think the design looks very simple and organized. All of the information that one would need is clearly displayed at an appropriate scale.",29,,,
"For future iterations, could it be possible to draw out other functions? I don't play the game but there should be space for more interaction outside of the game.",29,,,
"For the watch interface, if the breathing and heartbeat of the user is good, then the text or image should turn green, indicating that the user's state is positive.",29,,,
I like that there is a separate beginning workflow for drivers but I wish it were not so small so maybe you can make the driver's entry part bigger.,29,,,
"I like the idea of giving someone more creative and interactive tools, Im a little lost so more detail woud be great, but it seems like an interesting topic",29,,,
"I like the idea of improving one of Snapchat's flaws, but how much more creative can you be when designing an interface/interaction for this? Just something to think about!",29,,,
"I like your idea and I can see how important this can be for people in such a situation, both for EMTs and people asking help for real emergency.",29,,,
I think that the interface has a lot of functionality but I was wondering if you could add options to fill out or add more tax write up forms.,29,,,
I wish you can categorize buttons or screens by funtionality and it is better for users to get the visual guide immediatly to familirize the control without much training.,29,,,
I would like a physical time left during the game or maybe something that tracks time. It would be helpful to know how long each game is on average.,29,,,
I'm not sure whether there will be a privacy problem for the yard interface becasue not everyone wants to display what he or she has ordered in the public.,29,,,
"Maybe you should add a way for users to bid or counter offer the posted price, because the poster might not be aware of all the potential costs involved",29,,,
My hunch is that EMT people in such a situation should have a really simple and fast way to send out the report about current situation in current area.,29,,,
"Normally, the message notification is under the user section. Maybe you can combine the message to the ""Panera Bread(4)"", which can help you make the the top bar cleaner.",29,,,
"Overall, definitely, a very simple and yet powerful application. I can see myself using this ! It would be much cooler to have different features but good job !!",29,,,
"Since your persona is loking for all new furniture, maybe you can display sample arrangments of rooms and they can see where to find each item within the room.",29,,,
"The 3 rectangles take up a ton of space on the screen, they can be better consolidated and more effectively provide the user with input if they were nested",29,,,
"The bar ""next Due Date"" should be changed to ""Due Dates"" or something. The term next makes me think there will be one thing when I click on it.",29,,,
"The interface looks intuitive and easy to navigate. I like the use of increasing the text size for the scores, which indicates its importance to the game and user.",29,,,
"This application is absolutely something I would use, I am okay with walking a little distance if i know I'm getting the lowest price available and save some money.",29,,,
"This is really interesting. The pad not only supports laying down, but also supports standing against the wall when not in use. Very smart and efficient use of space",29,,,
"Who is the interface for? The event planners? Or the people who need rides. If it's for planners, you'd want it to be easy to change passengers and drivers.",29,,,
the last storyboard isnt really distinct from the 2nd one snoozing is a fine functionality to present but a better way would be to try explaining it as a need,30,,,
note since the link provided is codeinsuitsgithubionewhealthfund the corresponding repository would have been graded which we will expect from the next assignment which doesnt have a json at the moment,30,,,
at first i thought the observations centered around a general daytoday history but in the end the focus arranged around students learning experiences which i think is a good choice,30,,,
way too much text on this storyboard also what is this storyboard trying to convey intimidation in cooking or not knowing how to cook those are two separate user needs,30,,,
point awarded because you have the right idea of the point of view but i think you could better apply this to a more specific activity than simply playing games,30,,,
i dont think number of pages is an appropriate variable to measure here number of clicks before clicking find missions might be a better measure of what youre looking for,30,,,
theres a bug on the httpregionpoolxyzdashdestination page clicking on the suggested cross streets cities does not populate the text box only if i hit the enter button does it populate,30,,,
not sure what the difference is between the content in preparation instructions and the method selected in all meal components i think having real content would have made it clearer,30,,,
the video does demonstrate how the app is used but it does not reveal who the potential users are which is why i could not reward you with the point,30,,,
after creating a topic bubble and entering the bubble i am unable to add more topic bubbles this only happens when i create the bubble at the top most level,30,,,
point of view should be more concise for example your point of view would be fine even after the second the sentence as it captures the main problem of engagement,30,,,
you didnt provide a solution to the user need the user was still left disappointed i dont see the user interacting with your app to have hisher user need satisfied,30,,,
"About your foot sensor design, I am still doubting whether a normal foot toe movements might cause sending a false signal. But I guess we could just assume it works",30,,,
"Change ""Cancel"" to ""Cancel my ticket"" to maintain consistency. ""Cancel"" button should have less visual weight since it's a secondary button. You don't want the user to click on that",30,,,
"For idea 1 interface, it is better to have a desciption section for student's reply. Students can description their works, which helps buyers to choose the best one they like.",30,,,
"For sleep, food, and exercise, i really like how there is a search function but I would recommend adding filters to each category. It would make the search more efficient.",30,,,
I can see the app accidentally being triggered during a workout when the user forgets to say work out. How can the app distinguish between danger and a normal activity,30,,,
"Is there any reason car info is displayed twice? I think if you only represented it on the right, the space on the left could be used for something else.",30,,,
It might be better to specify the detailed scenario of your persona for different scale so that you may have a better idea of what to design in each interface.,30,,,
It seems to be cumbersome that the user has to wear sensors to determine posture. Try to find alternative ways to detect motion (video tracking) that don't inconvenience the user.,30,,,
It's hard to know where to look first and to know which info is most important. Perhaps utilizing different font weights and text decorations could help with emphasizing relevant information.,30,,,
It's limiting to have the info screen only show up when you point the camera at something. Why not just have it show the closest art piece to your location?,30,,,
"Or even better, to have colorerd background on the watch to indicate good and bad, and have text on it to show what is the suggestion of postures right now.",30,,,
"Perhaps maybe a simulated picture mode - displaying items in a virtual fridge, with icons indicating how fresh the food is / how urgently the food needs to be eaten",30,,,
"The heatmap idea is cool, but if the purpose of the design is to find available study rooms then maybe this space could be used to better represent the rooms.",30,,,
"The recovery view is very useful, a fitness assistant that factors in your ideal rest time and suggests workouts for you based on the ideal muscle groups is very applicable",30,,,
great job i enjoyed the consistent interaction flow aesthetics throughout the prototype and that is why i rewarded extra points im looking forward to its complete implementation in the coming week,31,1,0,1
think about how you can wizardofoz a concept that will be taught soon but you can see the video earlier the spotify integration since the idea hinges on it good work,31,,,
there are unique interactions in the app but theyve been poorly explained here and bunched along with those that are either auxiliary or not really unique less is more at times,31,,,
the needs are examples of what you can achieve through the outsourcing process itself rather than what users needs are for the mechanism of outsourcing that you will come up with,31,,,
the video only shows the aspect of the app where users can find deals theres no mention of your other features such as other people putting coupons shown in the video,31,,,
i couldnt find the part that reflects on what kinds of things you found heuristic evaluation valuable for and what kinds of things its not very useful for in your experience,31,,,
as per the instructions the purpose of that screen to give us an idea of how you expect users to interact with it which is missing hence the point is docked,31,,,
i wish the pov focused more on the problem why the subjects ended up failing to track the necessary information about nutritional intake and then its ultimate relation to health complications,31,,,
youre still in good shape keep going and it will be a great app dragging the button is somewhat sloppy see if you can use a better maybe even simpler animation,31,,,
apart from creatingviewing a workout i dont see any other tasks possible the app should definitely do more talk to me or any other ta about the scope of your app,31,,,
some of your needs are too tied to some sort of technology the needs should be very focused on behavior and motivation of language learning rather than the tools they use,31,,,
"A little confused by the solution and it seems like it may be too general purpose, don't give them the freedom to choose their layout, design the perfect layout for them.",31,,,
"At the inch scale, It might be hard to distinguish table from table. I could see people with larger fingers having trouble clicking one table over another with such small buttons.",31,,,
"Because this is a new technique, I wish you can add more details on the interface about the project to allow users to learn more about the project with further information.",31,,,
"I like the idea, but why not take it further and make an interactive board that the professor can use to add templates or autocomplete what they're writing on the board?",31,,,
I think your design uses space a lot better after the in class feedback! I wish there were more colors. You can add colors to buttons or text to differentiate them.,31,,,
"I'm unsure as to what the ""Mark as duplicate"" button does. Do you press this when you see symptoms listed twice? Does one then get deleted? How do you decide which?",31,,,
"Ideally, I believe the public display is like a giant Skype so that trainer and trainee can both see each other's body and trainee can give feedbacks in the real time",31,,,
Just a small thing; wouldn't we want to see that accepted is green? And that rejected would be a different color? I'd suggest you work on which colors indicate which priority,31,,,
"Out of curiosity, how would this be able to support multiple people? If I remember correctly, Melee supports up to 4 players at once; how would you implement this interface then?",31,,,
"Really like how clean it looks but would recommend not using that shade of blue for everything, it is hard to tell the difference among keys. Would recommend a different color!",31,,,
"The buttons for music/mode should be larger, especially on the watch interface. I think it would also be itneresting to play with a swipe interface to select either mode or music.",31,,,
The design for the schedule is not intuitive. Maybe you could have some symbols or color lump to better visualize the schedule. Show more graph features than words for this section,31,,,
"The only thing I would add to this is switching the desk to a sitting-standing desk, so that he can continue to work without worrying about his physical posture or comfortability.",31,,,
You could utilize a different text color for the friends with the longest snap streaks to make the content more salient. Doing this would also create a logical sense of hierarchy.,31,,,
update since you have used a database it effectively negates losing the point for not using data for the core functionality but you still need to do it for the next assignment,32,,,
no dead ends per say but links do not open projects filtering does not work and one of the major features of your app uploading a project doesnt seem to do anything,32,,,
nicely done however this isnt really possible with a web app so it might be wise to choose another idea or pivot please let me know if you need to discuss this,32,,,
what i really liked about this point of view is that you observed different kinds of activities and found a general pov that penetrates the painpoints you found from each of them,32,,,
good job overall but there wasnt any description of what kinds of things you found heuristic evaluation valuable for and what kinds of things its not very useful for in your experience,32,,,
instead of user needs your list details possible solutions an example for the first case would be users need an easier way to lock their bikes to posts more efficiently and effectively,32,,,
im not sure what really has improved from the previous iteration im assuming most things are under the hood which is good but not always adequate given the focus of this class,32,,,
good job on your assignment the interviews and insights found were very thorough and interesting your pov is also very strong and provides a lot of opportunities keep up the good work,32,,,
make sure to actually use the plan check things off as you are done and estimate the time needed for each task plan one week in advance ie for the next milestone,32,,,
also at least one of the needs focus on solutions srinivas needs simple dropdowns and functionalities to navigate websites you may ask what is it that having a dropdown interface can solve,32,,,
the video is well paced interesting way of using a sequence of images that are not too discontinuous however the potential users hinted are too specific try to make it more general,32,,,
on the map screen if i click view larger map it just takes me to google maps how will the info i input into google maps be relayed to the app itself,32,,,
"For me, the content is lacking a bit. I understand it is a simple use case but as such, I would like to see some interesting/unconventional interface instead of simply a tablet.",32,,,
"For the watch interface, I would recommend not having the list of groceries and instead have a google map/siri telling you where to go to get your items at the grocery store.",32,,,
"I am bit confused by the ""Send Notification"" and ""Note Participant. They are similar to me. If they are not, maybe you can change the term ""note participant"" to a clearer name.",32,,,
I am not sure how the 3D objects would work with the 2D screen. Is there a way to interact the with the 3D object to project them into the 2d screen_,32,,,
I don't know what this number means. Time I've spent in the room? Time left in the room? Where is the interface for selecting which room and for the length of time?,32,,,
I don't think there is a need to show all 4 years at once. It should show your current year and let you select other years if you wish to view them.,32,,,
"I like how simple the inch UI is, but I think that what the user needs to know is whether or not they need to do something. Maybe just stick to reminders?",32,,,
"I like the blue shades you have but I think it makes some of the text hard to read like shade of blue with ""fourth."" I would maybe try a different blue.",32,,,
I wish the app makes a distinction than adding a function to uber or lyft. For now it does not seem interesting enough.And I'm also confused what does the button setting do?,32,,,
"I'm curious to see what UI design you come up with - would it integrate using ASCII values to sort lists of users, or some sort of graphical interface to manually group?",32,,,
Im concerned with the use of the toes because they are very hard to move individually. Also how will the user know that they sent the right signal? Is there any feedback,32,,,
"interfaces are nice, but buttons look a little small - especially for the inch interface. Keep in mind most people won't be able to fit 3 fingers on the screen at once",32,,,
"It would be better to have the public display shows the recommended combo of fitness goals, because it reckon it would be a display on the wall of a gym or somthing.",32,,,
It would be nice if the tablet shows your class schedule on the weekly view and the events in that view so you know how each event may fit in your schedule.,32,,,
"It would be really cool to expand the buttons to allow for pencil gestures to trigger formatting. For example, putting a square around a line of text converts it into a header",32,,,
"Not sure about the alarm clock UI because it seems like you are showing too much, I would recommend showing the upcoming alarms or have something you can scroll through the alarms.",32,,,
"On the yard scale, I like how you have the current action showing at the bottom of the screen. It gives a live update of how the user is modifying the system.",32,,,
"Please explain more in-depth how one would have the glasses start its task - i.e. how the glasses know that he is baking brownies, how the glasses know he needed help, etc",32,,,
"Probably one thing that is needed by puzzle solver is that they need a way to manage their pieces, since with 1000 pieces it is easy to have some pieces got lost.",32,,,
"Switching between users should be changed, I don't think people will use or even see the user names so possibly where it says 'Pantry' that could be changed to reflect the user.",32,,,
while your p value is indeed 05 it is more better standard practice to report it at its greatest degree of significance which in this case is 01 so your pvalue is p01,33,,,
one point of extra credit for the drawing art implementation make sure you make it clear exactly what the purpose of your app is and differentiate it from simply a drawing art app,33,,,
tip mark stretch goals with a different colorbghighlight rather than a dedicated column also try to format it such that it can be seen at a glance rather than being on different pages,33,,,
interesting observation of what and how different people maintain some of their past histories it could be a little challenging to come up with a more concrete and unifying core need to tackle,33,,,
by adding extremely low level details about how to use the app on the script youre likely going to bias the user and not allow them to explore the app on their own,33,,,
i think the kind of comments you received from the other team is valid i also suggest looking into how to build the navigational flow and the main page more informative and intuitive,33,,,
think about deadlines so that you are on track each week also mention some stretch goals finally tasks should be more specific and actionable ps please select all relevant pages in the pdf,33,,,
the indicated user need is not unfulfilled in todays world with sites such as glassdoor and hence not really a need try to dig deeper about what heshe is unable to find easily enough,34,,,
honestly i think the current grade was as generous as possible i had differing opinions for two rubric items which i have explained but since they negate each other the final grade is unchanged,34,,,
"the pov is interesting but a little too focused on the solution 
 college students new grads need a tool to keep track of their networking activities with other connections in different source of communications",34,,,
by the way how do you feel about implementing the done button of the tasks view to reflect the chance in the home view ie clicking done removes the upcoming event from the home,34,,,
some of the changes you suggested are cosmetic different naming the size of the button etc and i think the focus should have been more on other important questions raised from your heuristic evaluations,34,,,
the base activity youre observing is not too clear its great that youre thinking of changing the status quo but this exercise is about finding situations where it may be necessary to begin with,34,,,
great job in implementing the overall functionality of the app although im excited for this development i also think that there is some potential for future improvement in both its aesthetics and the user interface,35,,,
i think you took detailed notes the subjects response to your interviews however i wish you mentioned in greater detail about the breakdowns and successes that the users faced as that was a bit unclear,35,,,
we believe your team deserves extra credit because the app had few bugs and has improved a lot from last week make sure to add some color other than that great job keep it up,35,,,
this pov focuses on the solution of having more accurate data instead your pov should focus maybe on the fact that navigation is difficult because the environment is always changing or the confusion in navigating,35,,,
it relates to the pov and a storyboard but im not sure what main concept of the app is besides being a way for users to input info about their dog from the prototype alone,35,,,
the development plan structure is kinda confusing also it does not lay out who is dedicated to each task it might be easier to organize by assignment and by task rather than by individual days,35,,,
sufficient but i also want to see more discussion about how you are fitting in with the brief what changes would you make with respect to that try to incorporate that in the next assignment,35,,,
some of your needs are quite insightful but others are more related to improving games rather than the behavior i especially liked the need you stated about having a busy mode in the physical world,35,,,
i think the race idea is interesting but try to think outside the realm of timers and task lists those ideas have all been done before planningscheduling apps are on my taboo list for that reason,36,,,
like i said in studio you might want to consider making the main page more visible and intuitive giving a clear sight of what your app provides and what possible outcomes does a user can expect,36,,,
some of the comments could have fallen in other heuristic categories ie used x to go back but panel 3 used a back arrow is listed under aestheticminimalist design when it should likely go under consistency,36,,,
good plan 4 hours for a title font good thing you labeled it as a stretch goal this is secondary add a task to find research articles that better motivate your choice of data game dynamics,36,,,
thank you for an awesome quarter you guys rocked enjoy the winter break and hope you earned some insight and inspiration from this course hope you a great new start for whatever youre trying to achieve next,37,0,0,0
i can appreciate how the forcefulness of the nudge is important but it doesnt justify a second prototype and should be part of the original one which would also improve it in terms of the flexibility heuristic,37,,,
think about how you can implement this if you choose this idea especially the automated voice since it is an important part of the app also look at existing apps to find if this is indeed new,37,,,
like i said in studio you would like to think about how your app fits in the entire cycle of networking right now it focuses on the initial interaction of collecting and exchanging contact information or resumes,37,,,
some of the needs are weakly connected to the observation or its breakdown for example it should be developed as a plugin as well in case user does not want to install another app to their phone,37,,,
instead of specifying which person had a need i would have recommended to make it more generalthat is replacing andrew edwin and michael with user and making google calendar theta tau rush events etc with calendar events,37,,,
decent but youre close to simply reiterating the pov of personal informatics with respect to finances keep in mind this is now taboo so consider a multifaceted approach or a facet of life that is not finances,37,,,
i am not sure why you have 2 navigation menus hamburger and kabob as a new user i would be confused as to which serves as the main menu perhaps change the icon of one of them,37,,,
furthermore this may not be the best ab test to do because besides the big orange button on the middle of the screen what else would they click it might be better to do a different test,37,,,
please provide the old plan too both in a readable format avoid links tip some columns can be removed others can be resized export the plan as a pdf and join pages online rather than using screenshots,37,,,
this is a decent point of view it combines a comment on people and their lives as well as incorporates motivation for citizen science do more background research into scientific questions that are usually asked in this domain,38,,,
to further expand the relevant design space i suggest observing people who participate in book clubs people who read leisurely and summarize what they have read in some form or people who try to find what to read,38,,,
i like the profiles for your users for scientists i wish there was a way to see their entire background maybe provide a link to a webpage outside your app that has more indepth information about the researcherinvestor,38,,,
the page titled task it have many buttons but none of them seem to be fully implemented yet also the tasks button only duplicates the current window into a new tab please check out the video below httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvg5t46bpxxyk,38,,,
your pov states past medical information and also that there is not a simple way to access these histories but there seems to be no way to access the historical information the 4th screen of the first prototype,38,,,
make sure to inform users via the interface itself how the recommended activities are chosen and what the set intervals button does i get it from your written summary but the interface doesnt talk about breaks too clearly,38,,,
interesting idea i like how you interviewed different types of musicians and were able to zone in on the major issues of song writing and collaboration your user needs are unique and insightful overall great job at needfinding,38,,,
be sure to explicitly state what you are planning on measuring with the ab test also you seem to want to track a lot and that may not be possible try focusing on just one aspect to test,38,,,
im assuming that making your personality transparent means that youre making your personality information available to others rather than making your personality not unique transparent as if it can be applied anywhere without a significant change for example,38,,,
some of the needs are dependent on the platforms specific feature types and thinking about having those features or not might bring some insights as to why certain interfaces are designed in their respective ways both bloggers need a way to easily see changes in their follower count and which specific accounts are following or unfollowing them ie other bloggers accounts or business accounts alyssa needs an easier way to sort out pictures to check if her photo will fit in well,38,,,
youre changing more than 1 thing Ê«one being the actual ui going from buttons to drop down and the second being that youre limiting the number of choices from any number to less than or equal to 3,38,,,
the only thing is that it is not explicitly clear that the app is supposed to a cleaning app among roommates or housemates also the currency system is not well explained how do users use their earned currency,38,,,
its unclear how to clear the goat i like your teams concept for this app and i think you can do a lot with that idea but a lot of the functionality isnt working yet or isnt completely clear,39,,,
great pov one suggestion is to put this statement into a context for example how does this statement relate to friends who want to join social events how does it relate to friends who want to organize such events,39,,,
really great job this week we believe you guys went above and beyond the criteria of this assignment the app may have a few bugs but the interactions are there and has improved from last week keep it up,39,,,
the way the app looks now makes this seem more about creativity rather than stress this isnt necessarily a bad thing but if your pov is about stress the stress component needs to be more clear within the app,39,,,
facebookyelp could be more unique examine lis 5 stage model and consider a multifaceted approach your idea might become more interesting if focused on a different stage of the personal informatics model generally preparation reflection and action are underrepresented,39,,,
i think you could have improved on explaining the specific breakdowns and successes that your subjects encountered during their activity some of the user needs were redundant overall i like the activity that you chose good job at needfinding,39,,,
it was interesting to see how people engage with various platforms to track their daily activities would there be any design opportunity neglected by not considering nonplatform usage though are you trying to develop a platform specific enhancement idea,39,,,
time estimation is missing although i mentioned that i look at hours spent more importantly to gauge even work distribution among the team members without providing time estimation of each task i cant give constructive advice about your task design,40,1,0,1
no github link provided in the submission informing us postdeadline helps you get the code graded but does not fetch the point the purpose of this rubric item is to avoid overhead which is important for such a large class,40,,,
not clearly linked to citizen science look more into scientific questions within this domain to better motivate your design figure out a way to make the user more than just a subject but an actual contributor to the scientific process,40,,,
doesnt take the current location and destination of the driver bob might be going from warren to scripps whereas the user needs to get from scripps to warren in which case the user cant really hitch a ride with bob,40,,,
for the remind johnny finish reflection page i was confused as to why there were more than one person on the list when you are just reminding johnny i wish the reminders only reminded the person involved with the task,40,,,
see previous rubric item for more focus less on the reminders too if i didnt say that already not core functionality but very close to it good candidate for wizard of ozzing focus more on the data and the visualizations,40,,,
there should definitely be some pointers about what is being represented for the benefit of new users since it is not clear otherwise tip what is covered in the textual explanation should end up as part of the onboarding process,40,,,
your distribution of work is uneven be sure that everyone is contributing a fair amount if this means a member isnt as comfortable with coding then they should be taking care of more of the design or user testing components,40,,,
your team is showing good progress with the application and the interactions are there i would suggest polishing up a few componentseg the drawerand finishing implementing the missing pageseg the page when clicking on the bottom left of the drawer,40,,,
also think about stretch goals it could be good to have those defined so that you can have a little bit of buffer when things get busy stretch goals could be some of the goals for the coming weeks for example,41,1,1,1
use better git commit messages aggj fgsdbb etc arent real messages having better messages makes rolling back easier in case a commit breaks your system you can look at some sample commit messages from a repo i was working on httpsgithubcomaloksmcrowdsbackendcommitsmaster,41,1,1,1
some tasks are not specific or actionable enough such as implement setting page also include time estimates and appropriate deadlines week 6 has all on the same day accounting for any off daysholidays the whole purpose is to use the plan,41,,,
leaves too much to the imagination and you create bias by telling them too specifically what to do and what the app is about we also want to know how they respond to the site prima facie without any knowledge beforehand,41,,,
think about stretch goals and deadlines within the week also make sure to plan at least one week ahead tasks for a5 arent owned by team members yet the entire purpose is to use the plan to keep things going well,41,,,
reflection pinpoints the major problems of the other teams two prototypes however the paragraph is missing your thoughts on heuristic evaluations therefore i could not reward you the point good insights on your hes and solutions to the other teams problems,41,,,
"it would have been better if some of the need statements were more explained student needs a better way to view upcoming assignments better than what
 student needs a better way to differentiate between assignments for different classes better in what way",41,,,
interesting concept of racing against friends to do tasks what i think might be more unique is thinking of ways to hold friends accountable for their tasks and tasks should not be limited to homework as this should be more generalizable,41,,,
its fine to fake it this week but there should be some substance too by a8 esp for extra points point docked as there is little auxiliary functionality such as editing major leavingchanging a group that make the app relatively static,41,,,
i just realized youve recreated a questionanswer forum lol i think the way you distinguish it is by everything being more data driven i think the best way to do this is to force all of your data to be numerical,41,,,
if you click on the current location icon on the top left it throws an error saying geolocation error only secure origins allowed this is because it hasnt been loaded over https but if loaded over https your map doesnt load,41,,,
some tips add messages that inform your users that a task is created currently in progress or completed also inform the users that they officially blocked websites this will ensure that the app is meeting the visibility of system status heuristic,41,,,
some tasks for your code 2 screens section are rather vague you could improve this by breaking up the coding into separate tasks of html css javascript coding in general be a bit more specific about what exactly each task entails,41,,,
the second wireframe doesnt make it obvious to anyone who sees this that the two field panes can be used to select fields in the manner you demoed earlier this week without the demo i would have thought those were links,41,,,
while you did present a good list of changes some of them did not relate well to the heuristics mentioned heuristic evaluations are more about the interactions within the app rather than the features or the playability experience in this case,41,,,
try to make it more elaborate youre not just trying to satisfy the storyboard but also associated needs and expectations of a user would they need to create activities every week how can they duplicate a workout to avoid repeated input etc,42,,,
your tasks are too generic and broad more detail please for instance i have no idea what your app actually does from reading the plan when i should be able to tell what functionality you plan to implement by reading the plan,42,,,
there might be some design space left to think about how to streamline the overall process i believe all the steps involved in creating a post of a place demonstrated in the video prototype are necessary but could it be further simplified,42,,,
the idea of observing what types of consoles a person plays with does not relate to games with a purpose the point of the brief is to explore how the motivational and rewarding aspects of games can influence behavior in everyday life,42,,,
awesome data input screen you shouldnt have a question about punishment positive reinforcement only no reward if no work reward if work also emotion degree isnt very intuitive apply your experience with heuristic evaluation i need a better orientation to the data,42,,,
almost finished but the part where user uploads her clothes is not fully functional also clicking the buy it button doesnt operate as expected some of the items seems to be added to my closet but some are not check out httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlljp2gfztwk,42,,,
since we do not penalize twice for the same mistake this point is not docked this time around please note that we only grade one repo per team you must aggregate work as the total is not simply the sum of the parts,43,,,
the instructions are clear but there isnt really a script it might be useful to develop a script that places the user in a scenario where they might want to add a new location as this would be more realistic to your app,43,,,
interesting observation of what selforganization means for different individuals however i felt it a little difficult to unify the diversity of activities to this pov for example does ivan having only 10 knives require a lot of work for him to organize them,43,,,
i think the pov itself is a valid statement but im not sure if it can be extrapolated from the activity observed especially because the observation was centered around a specific platform that happens not to have certain features required for the activity,43,,,
user needs should be in the form similar to user needs something it should address what the user is trying to get done and the needs they have to get them there your statements offer solutions and are not addressed to the user,43,,,
the best povs are nowhere near recommending a specific solution and instead are a comment on people and important aspects of life some examples are library books are valuable yet underutilized people want to do good deeds but life gets in the way,43,,,
great job in running through the finish line and polishing up the app thank you for an awesome quarter you guys rocked enjoy the winter break and hope you earned some insight and inspiration from this course now off to a great new start,44,0,0,0
try to make it glanceable to improve usability tasks such as work on ajax requests are vague and not actionable enough finally the graphs can be moved at the end as they dont serve a purpose except when you are changing the plan itself,44,,,
be careful with budget apps because most of them end up looking like mint or simply being a budget input app the garden idea is pretty interesting and i think you should focus more on how to take advantage of those sorts of rewards,44,,,
point awarded because this does connect to one of your storyboards but its unclear how this is different from most map applications is this just a map with better search results how does this apply to the studio brief of games with a purpose,44,,,
i like the scenario in which you frame the task but the task is very general and a user might get confused as to how to successfully accomplish try specifying your task a bit more to get the user to do something more concrete,44,,,
interesting needs found from the list but i wish it focused more on why than the solution for example calling is sometimes preferedsic over texting for those direct interaction such as hanging out there should be a way to store it in history too,44,,,
good job in creating the first version of the app i think there is still some potential for improvement and the fact that there is no interactivity associated with the tree visualization other than adding and deleting a member affects the apps usability and attractiveness,45,,,
good job on this weeks assignment on the development plan the tasks can be more specific actionable instead of html template for bills screen it can reword to be display users bills history for example for next weeks development plan update please make these changes,45,,,
i think its an interesting idea to look at bank transaction records and decode what did the individual do at which time and where but discussing about the confusion the current software applications or having multiple cards incurs is a little stretched from the observation,45,,,
good job in running through the finish line as a 2person team thank you for an awesome quarter enjoy the winter break and hope you earned some insight and inspiration from this course hope you a great new start in whatever youre trying to achieve next,46,0,0,0
after reading the unique interaction i find that adding viewing a company application or profile is important but more appropriately considered core functionality something i would suggest as an example is to enable users to be able to notify the their recruiters of their timelines deadlines,46,,,
plz remove login credentials collect more data about each spot who you went with what you did why it was enjoyable etc improve visualizations pasting in handdrawn images works make it clearer how the map works if you insist on keeping it as an input mechanism,46,,,
this point of view is more a comment on citizen science interfaces themselves what id rather see is something like citizen science can be used to answer this scientific question as well as describing your point of view as to why that question is important to answer,47,,,
while i agree that the sample size is smaller than what you would have liked the chisquare test is designed to be more objective for interpreting raw numbers much more so than objective percentages you cant cite percentage differences when you mention that your redesign did better,47,,,
because of the struggles of the interviewees the observation writeups were very engaging for the next team assignment if your team decides to keep working on this subject it would be beneficial to analyze other banking apps that serve similar purposes and look for latent design opportunities,47,,,
i would actually argue that the button might lead to faster clicks because it is a button and people are able to interact with buttons much easier than a hamburger menu as common as hamburger menus are in mobile apps they actually have pretty poor information scent,47,,,
the entire application is centered around ride sharing and the core functionality of the application drivers being able to create rides and riders being able to see potential rides is not working since the main functionality of your application is missing i cannot award you the point,47,,,
some observations you made contain valuable insights about the design and how its communicated with the users for example we have to listen carefully to comments like itsic was trying to figure out why the feed was motivating i did not really understand the point of it,47,,,
the protocol is well designed and puts a good focus on the interactions of the applications the core functionality of the application still appears to be missing i would encourage your team to focus on that aspect being able to create projects share them before implementing other features,48,,,
make sure to actually use the plan and check things off as you go distribute the tasks and not be too specific about the time just ballpark it some tasks are genericvague ex datajson with fake data what data you are faking on which page is not clear,48,,,
we expect a complete app in that it satisfies reasonable expectations a typical user will have so that it can easily have at least two screens the scope of this app is exceedingly narrow and the second screen is apparently an extension of the first not a different screen,49,,,
what i really liked about this point of view is that it puts commuting in a context ie the beginning of a long stressful day which made me wonder would there be other contexts that commute might well be placed in for example at the end of the day,49,,,
great job on the assignment the development plan could be improved by rewording your task names to be more actionable instead of code nutritional facts page put display nutritional facts on the nutrition page when your development plan is updated for a5 reword your tasks to be more actionable,49,,,
i think the pov you included contains some of the needs and insights you pulled from your observation but not all for example there were several needs related to user frustration linked to not having an efficient convenient way of gathering relevant travel information but that seems to be neglected,50,,,
another note which is optional but encouraged you can improve your development further by adding in constraints will anyone be working on it during thanksgiving is someone busy with midterms or out of town for a weekend this can make your development plan have more realistic time estimations and goals,50,,,
to me the most meaningful part of your app is the voting feature that allows users to see and get feedback on their own training habits this is slightly overlooked by the other tasks in your protocol you might want to focus on the core task as the primary function,50,,,
great job at needfinding i liked how you went into detail about your observations with each subject and the breakdowns they encountered your list of user needs are all unique and insightful overall i like this idea in how it correlates with the theme of bettering the community at home,50,,,
privacy is secondary functionality for now the alert based on gps is not as important as better clarifying your data and your questions about the data good call on the friends feature thats secondary change 5 is really a good example of what you should be focusing on at this stage,51,,,
it would be better if i received some sort of confirmation that my eventlocation was successfully shared right now i have to navigate to the recommendations which does not make the most sense there should be some history of my locations recommendations simply implies that those are locations that i might like,52,,,
the main page could be a little more visual would how many days are you prepping for be the best question to ask the potential users the firsttime user immediately has to make a choice out of 7 options what would the user be thinking at this point of the apps entry,52,,,
however my general feeling on anonymous posting is that it is hard to shepherd the users to contribute positively to the app and other users in some courses the list of comments already is too long and users have to look into each of them to find the most relevant information they want,53,,,
some of the needs presented here doesnt directly relate to the breakdowns nor the observations provided for example people need ways to track their past isnt really a need that can be inferred from the observation since they might well be tracking their past ie by uploading pictures or updating statuses on facebook,53,,,
i like your idea not only is it creative but it also matches the theme of bettering the community of students who are interested in learning new programming languages i like how detailed your observations were in that you were able to take note of their successes and breakdowns overall great job at needfinding,54,,,
good job this week the development plan can be improved it seems to be missing the time estimations for the task and the tasks can be more specific and actionable instead of finalize unique features you can write display user profile information on the user page as an example next week please make these changes,55,,,
some of the findings that are listed under not a heuristic could indeed fall under one of the heuristics for example confusing indication of pending requests on home page would fit under match between system and real world because the indication does not match what users have typically come to know as a requests indicator,55,,,
im not confident that i understood the idea behind the second storyboard by showing a person who originally got rejected from a company getting an offer from the same company after a year with a screen of a mobile device of different company logos did not give a concrete idea of how this app operates,55,,,
please dont reuse links until the previous assignment is graded i tried a few times with incognito but couldnt see the alternative redesign im happy to regrade with a new link as long as you deploy a predeadline commit also unrelated to the grade make sure the links work the first one with www does not,56,,,
editing tasks does not work also it is unclear for a firsttime user what exactly the unique purpose of the app is if i were a naive user i would assume that the rewards are real money and i would not get the point that it is supposed to be an app to share among houseroommates,56,,,
what is the specific need that youre addressing try to identify the reason why people are frustrated andor why they have to search for a space is availability unpredictable and why or are they not well acquainted with the campus that might help you go beyond a superficial solution or be able to justify it better,56,,,
interesting pov personally i would endure extra cognitive and mechanical effort if i could have a good experience overall from cooking not sure if the experience of eating out at a restaurant can be precisely compared to that of cooking on your own but this pov states something that people can relate to which is good,56,,,
there are many possibilities of what the app can do or how it can do it than the rather limited scope of coming up with a group what if you dont want to work with someone for whatever reason try making it less focused on a behindthescenes algorithm and more about the interactions that will satisfy the pov,58,,,
it would be great if you could infuse some more insights from observing real users into the prototypes you might want to look into user interactions from various angles during the heuristic evaluation sessions this might be crucial to answering questions like why should i use this instead of or along with amazon kindle or goodreads for example,58,,,
your needs state a lot of solutions these should only be focused on the users for example instead of your 11th need you could say cashiers need a way to rotate being at the register and performing other duties this need is general enough that multiple solutions could be implemented for it while also capturing the core user need,59,,,
itd be cool if you could put some recurrent events as fake data then show the distribution of emotions for each of the occurrences of the event also the graphs are all oversized and dont fit on my screen put in a menubar that i can use to select the different visualizations i would make your app more interactive,59,,,
something that might be better to measure is whether users accept a quest more in the original design or the redesign presumably if the redesign is easier to understand then they should be accepting or completing quests more because they are able to understand the purpose from the page instead of trying to figure out how to navigate the page,60,,,
theres a slight dead end that i believe could be avoided for now it seems like when you click on comment of the circle and there are no additional comments on it the user just reaches a blank page it might be beneficial to prevent the user from navigating to that page if there are no comments on the circle,60,,,
it would be useful to sequence the tasks and deadlines in a useful order next break up tasks into specific not generic such as making sure app reads json data and actionable chunks especially for coding also its fine to simply ballpark time estimates instead of going into precise numbers the whole purpose is that the team uses the plan easily,61,,,
good job on mostly finishing the functionality thinking about the cold start problem ie users who have just started using the application might give you some insight about how to restructure some of the interaction flow right now signing up with a new account leads to the same view as trung one extra point was rewarded for implementing interactive graph rendering,61,,,
good you get the basics of the brief but your writing is still missing details about how you are pivoting our main idea is to make the analysis of the users personal data useful to user as feedback in other words to help the users fight against procrastination through the data thats not really saying very much what data what analysis,61,,,
a3 feedback good job at your he heuristic names should be fully stated controlfreedom to user control and freedom metaphors to match between system and real world i wish the list of he went more in depth explaining exactly why it violated that heuristic as some of were questionable for example how does reliance on submenus for core functions violate aestheticminimalist design,62,,,
even though the storyboards do correspond with the pov of allowing the community to voice their problems the main issue seems to revolve around parking so if someone else were to pick up these storyboards they might think that the pov has something to do with solving the issues of parking rather than allowing communities to voice their opinion about all issues,62,,,
there might be some design space left to think about how to incentivize users to come back to the platform after they decided their classes some students might be willing to know more detailed information about the structure of the course or how the workload changes over the quarter for example maybe we can gather more information about the quarter mid 3quarter checkpoints,63,,,
great job this week development plan seems wellthoughtout however the tasks can be more specific and actionable instead of code homepage write display create task run task settings logout help buttons on the home page not only is this a requirement but it allows the team to know in great detail what should be done so for next weeks update include these changes,63,,,
to understand the various situations and interaction between the app and the users creating a reusable prototype like made out of a piece of plywood for example and carrying it around for a length of time a week for example could be helpful i think particularly paying attention to someone who just finished preparing for the weeks worth of meals could be beneficial,63,,,
this prototype focuses solely on running but your pov is more general than that are you only doing a running app how does this app differ from other running apps i suggest doing a competitive analysis of other fitness apps to gain inspiration but also to ensure that you dont do something exactly similar this seems very much like the nike running app,63,,,
i wish the splash page 1st screen had a slogan of what your application does food for thought can be about anything food related try to narrow it down to the main functionality and explain in a short sentence the goal of your app for example slacks slogan is were on a mission to make your working life simpler more pleasant and more productive,64,,,
given that most of your users confusion stemmed from not understanding the training icon as opposed to visiting the dog profile your ab test should probably focus more on that aspect its difficult to measure how many clicks it takes for a user to find something because this could be confounded with a number of factors and is not directly linked to a particular action,65,,,
video feedback i enjoyed watching the video and i thought the acting was great especially the ending with hungs extreme satisfaction from watching the video i like how the interface of your prototype was simple one thing i am wondering about is does the app only block websites or does it block other apps too think about how feasible it will be to implement this,65,,,
i think theres a little tension between the two questions at stake how would we effectively in terms of what importance of the event record and represent our past vs how can we record our past in a complete manner such that we can always go back and look for the things when we forget we would eventually like to focus on one to the other,66,,,
a3 feedback nice he and thorough explanations of your feedback like i said before i wish a comparison was provided between the other teams prototypes to help them understand the advantages and disadvantages of their design going forward think about the possible ways to upload your notes through the video it seems that your notes have to be typed up into the appthat sounds a bit tedious,67,,,
also you might want to think about the current flow of the app if its primary purpose is to make people meet other people then why not just have them at least be able to browse and see other people out there in the platform and if they think there are quite a few interesting people then require them to input the mbti type for making matches,67,,,
great job observing users and distilling insights from them however this specific rubric item asked to collect and group notes for each observant first before distilling insights because a concrete user scenario which contributes to storytelling and building a persona is often powerful even when in a breakdown scenario here the grouping is somewhat vague and the users identity is washed off but still very detailed and structured observations,69,,,
these needs are too focused on the idea of a calendar the calendar is the solution not the need a better way to word these might be students need a way to know all their events for the day at any point notice that there is no mention of the method in which they would use this some of the needs can also be grouped as the same need,69,,,
a3 feedback very indepth explanation of your he i like how yall went above and beyond the assignment requirements by providing reflections on your own prototypes images and he worksheets going forward think about how to check if the scientists are providing legitimate research articlesprojects there has been multiple scandals where publication companies do not review articles online resulting in fake information leaking out how will your app avoid this issue,71,,,
while i like how you are testing the follow button it may be difficult to obtain any significant results from the exp because people may simply like to press the button if you get what i am saying there is essentially nothing that is preventing them from clicking it again such as a new page change so that is why i am somewhat skeptical of what your results will be like,71,,,
some of the needs are weakly related to their respective breakdowns for example in addition he was looking through a powerpoint about punjabi culturehis culture that he was planning to give to a group of students he stated that he is afraid that the younger generation may not be educated enough about their culture and all together take no notice of it is not a breakdown but is used to suggest needs,72,,,
its confusing that even though the exercise category doesnt exist possible for novice users the add repetitions button etc still exist at the bottom and do not work thinking about the cold start problem ie users who have just started using the application might give you some insight about how to restructure some of the interaction flow right now signing up with a new account leads to the same view as trung,72,,,
some of your needs were focused on improving games rather than improving the human behavior i think youre on the right track with some of your insights for example your need a socially awkward or introverted gamer needs a way to connect with others on a deeper level and games can be a spark to a deeper friendship this need is actually really insightful and could be explored with a design solution,72,,,
dont spend too much time on the heart animation you can just put in html pictures for different levels id like to see other visualizations like a line graph of completed acts of kindness by day week month also you should categorize acts of kindness which you can then visualize at an aggregate level for instance donating money vs donating time then you can compare all the tasks youve done under those categories,73,,,
overall feedback redesigned page needs improvement the label covers the input text which makes the forum look messy the updown feature to input timedate could be more fluid ie i use the updown button to change the hour but when i want to go to minutes i cant click on minutes to change the time i have to click the right arrow key to move to minutes which isnt ideal through a phone,73,,,
i like this idea of allowing students help their peers building a sense of community among them as seen in the video the app helps people find seats what other issues are yall planning to solve perhaps narrow it down to one issue or provide categorization find seatsfind parkinghw helpetc having an app that helps a broad range of issues may lead to an app that is just for chatting about miscellaneous topics,73,,,
good start heres a tool that ive made for myself google eisenhower principle httpsgoogl4yuqgt use it as inspiration for the data you are going to collect then think about what visualizations are going to be most important from the data you collect also think about other facets of ones life that contribute to procrastination relationships healthsleep etc what do you think contributes to procrastination the most if you talk to people about it,73,,,
i think this prototype doesnt completely connect to the pov as it does not show how its accomplishing the goal of centralizing information the page 4 of the prototype for example is not contributing to the goal any more than what email already does typically a thread of conversation exchanged between an applicant and a recruiter at the company will contain all the information jobview has but an email account typically contains many more,74,,,
looking at your wireframes i was unsure about the purpose of the emojis why are some circles bigger than others why are some circles offscreen the organization of the app is difficult to understand what is going on and i am unsure about what i should be doing if you are designing the app to look like the wireframe i would advise that you clean up the wireframe such that it is better organized,74,,,
an interesting idea to look at the activity of reading as historical the observation is detailed and how they interact with their reading material is elaborated however quite a few of the pain points reported can be remedied once we converted the reading material digitally therefore the needs presented are mediumdependent which in turn can be thought as interfacedependent if you think of the medium ink on a a sheet of paper as an interface,75,,,
and the followings are your need statements the order of presentation isnt consistent with above 1 people need a social timeline platform where they can store all their emotions and easily maybe automatically set visibility to their friends acquaintances and strangers 2 people need a way to store the emotion and get the arty and poetic feeling of handwriting when they are using digital diary 3 people need a way to associate photographs with emotions,75,,,
from the pov people become forgetful when they are overwhelmed with too much information at once in a short span of time peoples way to learn should be simplified by reducing interactions as much as possible and also reduce computational complexity from the environment and digital device what is the different between reducing computational complexity from the environment and digital device and peoples way to learn should be simplified by reducing interactions as much as possible,76,,,
a note about your overall pov and idea i could see this app being used for fitness purposes in addition to what you intend ie setting a goal location to run to and racing to get there under a certain time thats not necessarily a bad thing but you should either take advantage of that and capitalize on it or flesh out your original idea a bit more so its more clear that its the main purpose of the app,80,,,
a3 feedback thorough explanation of your he i like the idea on informing ucsd students about all the food locations on campus going forward think about how this application will cater to both new and old students maps and directions to locations and how to motivate your users to continue using the app offer discounts also ucsd does provide a directory of all the food places on campus and i suggest doing a competitive analysis on their app with your app,81,,,
some of the needs are focused on the solution rather than the actual feelings of the users independent of the platforms they use for example both student 1 needs update his habits app everyday to be able to have accurate statistics to show his productivity levels and student 2 needs to be able to physically be able to mark offcrossoff tasks completed right after she has completed them involve a specific type of action update the habit app and interface markoffcrossoff capability,82,,,
your observation was very diverse and engaging i believe the statement describes the current challenge of storing selfhistories into the design space correctly i would like you to think about why it is highly distributed what if people like certain aspects of some platforms and therefore choosing to use them without further understanding what drives them to use specific services and platforms it is hard to ultimately convince others to replace or use sidebyside all of them with the service you will provide,83,,,
the variables used are not appropriate for a chisquare test because the variables of sessions and views are not categorical meaning they are not mutually exclusive from each other an example of appropriate categorical data would be click or no click on a web page button for the original and variant pages because you cannot both click and not click a button in your calculation you cannot accurately assume how many individual page views were made per session and thus the calculation doesnt fit the test,86,,,
the app looks amazing so far despite some dead links a few notes i like how every screen informs where the user is currently user at bills screen says bills etc however be sure to add the name of your app on all your screens there also seems to be three ways for navigation profile helpsettinglogout chatbillschores perhaps combine two menus into one ie profile with helpsettinglogout having more than two menus may confuse your users overall great job cant wait to see your progress next week,87,,,
the instructions are thorough but too specific the task should be more general so as to apply more generally to what a user might do with the app in addition the task doesnt capture the unique interaction of the app as this is typical of most budgeting apps some things i think you will need to think about going forward is how to make your app stand out and why the wishlist feature is important or special at the moment the interactions are highly similar to other budgeting apps,89,,,
good start your project has the benefit of being very multifaceted and you can go nuts with the type of data you collect i really liked how on fridays youre exhausted tired sad so you used that information to change your schedule come at the data from a more balanced approach placing equal weight to the different facets emotions and productivity seem covered well but what else make sure to drop features that are basically recreating a calendardiary app simplify those so that you can really focus on the interaction with the data,93,,,
adding a new add friends feature could be an idea to solve the usability issue involved with requiring users to input the email address ie having to pull out ones phone or laptop lookup the persons contact info try to verify which email address out of 3 that the person youre trying to add has the entire sequence of these actions could be really tedious and overwhelming to firsttime users for example but without thinking through the cause of the painpoint theres a fair chance of complicating your system with the new feature while not solving the usability issue,99,,,
good job at needfinding i liked your ideal overall i think it is very creative and i think you noticed a number of breakdowns which proves that this is a common problem among the community of college students some of the user needs were repetitive and i believe you can definitely dive deeper into this issue for example what are the needs of those who arent concerned with dressing up in the morning how does that compare to those who do take the time to check the weather to wear something appropriate does planning outfits play a role in their social life,102,,,
great job this week i like where the app is going just make sure to keep nielsens heuristics in mind and include messages that will help the users understand the systems status and diagnose errors the application is also missing some sort of help and documentation login pagesplash page is encouraged to have a summary of what your app does before they enter your app some questions i had can users add classes can users remove themselves from classes what are updates for will viewing the notes show how many likes an dislikes it currently has try to address these questions for user testing,104,,,
some of the needs sound redundant to me 1 mudit needs a way with lesser interaction to search the words he doesnt know on his smartphone so that he doesnt waste too much time 2 mudit needs a way to save a word with its meaning directly without copy and pasting it on ms word from the pc 3 mudit needs to track the words and their meanings he searches on his smart phone without going through the browser history 4 christopher needs a way to look for the meaning of the word that would not make him leave reading his article in between,104,,,
sufficient but i also want to see more discussion about the brief the calendar seems like secondary functionality focus more on the data and the questions you are asking so far i only see the question how do these events make me feel flesh out more relevant information you would collect with less attention to the events timing information you dont really need a calendar for the timing information just a start and end time and a date sure it makes looking over the weeks events easier but a normal calendar app can do that i suggest rethinking how you want to visualize time for the user,107,,,
about the remindthework feature i urge you to observe users in a reallike situation what users actually want could be something very different from what you think is needed for them for instance maybe you will learn that what users are most curious at any given time of scheduling their own workload is to have an answer for the question how am i doing what is the most optimal task to do next given that i have done x y and z recently maybe you might want to design an instant performance review feature or a search recommendation system that lets users search for specific tasks of interest,108,,,
the pov is very interesting if we were to provide some sort of visual artifacts that could potentially increase our ability to recall the question is how would we be able to summarize it and make it not cumbersome on an extreme end one could continuously record every second of ones life but does it provide any value then if the video is 24 hours long but if were only given 24 hours a day as well on the other hand if we summarized it and recorded only the important piece of information wouldnt we still be losing stuff since we lose things when we are most unaware of them,110,,,
a3 feedback thorough explanation of your hes i think this idea of creating an app that helps keep others in check is interesting its a lot more personal when someone reminds you to do something rather than an alarm going forward think about how to motivate your users to remind each other will they get some type of reward if they complete their tasks on time or when the person is an allstar leader and always reminds people to do their work will they get some type of recognition too also think about the situation of when the all parties of the group forget to remind each other what should happen,111,,,
however i found that some needs are not connected to and corroborated by the observations nor the breakdowns reported for example the followings are the parts in your observation that contain the word emotion 1 in weibo she tends to post negative and angry emotions when she is down which she says is because there is less acquaintances in weibo in friend circle on the other hand she always post positive stuff in order to show the best of her to her friends 2 she also uses selfiestick to shoot videos during her traveling because she thinks it is hard to store emotion in photos 3 she concluded that handwriting can stores emotions for her,115,,,
i found some of the needs presented are weakly connected to the activity you observed use their computers and visit sitesmediums in which they were viewing news stories andor keeping track of personal information of any sort and the pov bringing in visuals in place of large chunks of small text could potentially stimulate the brain more than just reading through the material word for word and trying to comprehend what each word means santpreet needs a way to better understand stock rises falls and predictions because as a businessfinance major this material is very relevant to him santpreet needs a fun and fresh way to bring more cultural awareness to his community of fellow punjabis,116,,,
the app is so cute i like the icons and the splash page the home page and restaurant page have clearcut features some of the pages ex affordability do not have back buttons and the hamburger menu icon doesnt seem to do anything next week please ensure that the menu works and back buttons are added speaking of back buttons the back button on the home page should be removed unless it has an important functionality the home page should be an introductory page for the users so it would be confusing if the user saw a back button they would think they are not on the home page overall i am liking where you guys are going and i cant to see your update next week,127,,,
i think the list of changes you made are great but im concerned that the effect of different pieces of changes included in the new version might make the test result harder to analyze for example on the matches page not only each persons profile has been changed from a list view to a grid view but also now there are buttonlooking buttons compared to the original linklooking buttons for chat on the top of the page right under matches it indicates what kind of person youre looking for as well which might also affect the users mental state this is important since this change isnt necessarily following the same logic as with others mainly about how peoples profiles are laid out in the view therefore i recommend you to separate out some of those changes and create different urls that contain individual changes and compare the result,148,,,
beautiful and wellfunctioning app i like the unique features you have so far some notes the home button should always be visible your app logo is cute use it as an easy access to the home page the page after you sign in speaking of the home page remove the back button to the login page because the user already logged in they should only be able to return to this page when they signed out i like how the pages are informative about the restaurant and dishes as a user i would be interested in what the dish or the restaurant might look like add images to help your users choose between dishes lastly remember to take into consideration what your peers said to you in class the color palette can be darker the list of items should be in alphabetical order unless filtered the word filter should be visible and make clickable links more buttonlike i think your development plan can be slightly improved by making the tasks more specific overall great job,175,,,
good job this week i like where the app is headed and how the tasks from the datajson is related to your app x some notes definitely keep the nielsens heuristic in mind as you move forward such as consistency aesthetic and minimalist design error prevention etc in the menu notifications is denoted as an icon while the other links are denoted by text keep it consistent consistency speaking of the notification icon i am not sure what it was at the beginning it looks really small and ambiguous match between real world and system app seems text heavy aesthetic and minimalist design and as i mentioned in class perhaps cover the description of the task until clicked open still leave the reminder button visible to remove unnecessary text overall i like the unique implementations but make sure they are fully implemented for user testing as mentioned in your assignment a unique interaction is that your app allows you to remind members of your group but your app seems to lack a way to add members to your group is this something you want toshould implement,186,,,
a3 feedback beautiful submission so colofrul and thorough explanation of your he i noticed this statement under recognize diagnose and recover from errors these are paper prototypes you cant do this with paper prototypes how is it even possible to answer your question imagine the app had a log in page and i forgot to include my email one popular way to implement a clear error message to help me recognize diagnose and recover from this error is to include a red asterisk on the email field as a way to tell me to correctly fill in this field to include this in a paper prototype you can add another screen that has this error message going forward this idea of providing an organized and easy way for housemates to implement house rules is interesting it perfectly illustrates what the issues are that households may have billing and chores to better your app further try performing a competitive analysis with your app features and existing apps such as your billing feature with venmo another note your app seems to have a lot of features keep in mind the time limit you will have and prioritize which features are more important to implement and which ones should be left to wizard of ozing,212,,,
organization of the topics could be made more intuitive and the app itself should be better structured to highlight the main functionality of that page topics and discussions should be separated therefore the home page should only display topics and when you click the topic there you can show all the commentsdiscussions that people are having combining them together on one page can overwhelm your users moving forward make sure to add in more messages to inform your users what they did if user created a topic notify the user that they created a new topic this will ensure that the visibility of the system is clear to the user heuristic make sure that each screen has the name of your app as well as the name of the current page that the user is on keep the back buttons consistent some back buttons have labels while others dont another heuristic speaking of back buttons what is the purpose of the back button on the home page the user should not think that they are not in the home page and a back button can be confusing unless it serves a reasonable purpose i would remove the back button on the home page over all good job cant wait to see your progress next week,215,,,
good job this week i think the app has potential as the unique features mentioned in your assignment sound really cool and i believe that are something your users are interested in some tips on how to brush up your app i think these unique features should be more visible as a scientist i want to upload projects instead of allowing users to easily upload a project they must view my projects to upload a project even though this page should have an upload button i noticed that i was having difficulty figuring out that i had to go that page first to upload a project perhaps have a readily button that allows me to upload project in one click moving forward make sure that your unique functions are completely implemented or done through wizard of oz also make sure that the buttons are doing what they expect to do i noticed that when i try to click the logo which should take me back to home page the article on the homepage which should show me the whole article and the pagination at the bottom of the home page does not seem to be fully implemented i also noticed that the user account has a lot of edit options perhaps have a universal edit option to make the profile page less cluttered nielsens heuristics minimalist design,227,,,
