344,the captions on the photos didnt give much insight into the breakdowns that happen during the speech,0,17
345,another useful perspective would have been to observeinterview someone who listened to one of these peoples talks,0,17
346,this is just extra reading if youre up for it but heres don normans views on using powerpoint slides for public speaking httpwwwjndorgdnmssindefenseofpowerphtml,0,23
347,the observations need to reflect on how the use of photos made the photo taker andor the photo viewer feel the first observation had this but the others didnt,1,29
340,observation should also contain some reflectionconnection to the brief not merely factual account only the first observation seem to do this,0,21
341,sketch should serve as a documentary for each activity only one seems to be directly connected,0,16
342,the observation plan is vague specifically what kind of communication and what kind of information,0,15
343,how the observations relate to sharing stories and feeling empathy is never made explicit,0,14
348,observations mostly refer to the paragraph above,0,7
349,photo 3 im not sure victor having a good time with an existing system is so much of a design opportunity,0,21
1653,enjoyed having you in studio really liked your critical thinking about the pov,0,13
298,observation description requires more info for example you say arman started implementing several tactics but only give one instance as an example,0,22
299,no photossketches provided,0,3
296,good job,37,2
297,how does each of the musicians practice help with their storytelling some of your reflection would be helpful not just a factual account,0,23
294,well done i like how you observed a lot of different interesting facets of the broad activity of goods exchange,0,20
295,i think the observation of people asking their friends what they think about products is very telling people often would rather hear and trust opinions from those who they know rather than internet strangers,0,34
292,great observations,0,2
293,finding some way to observe an activity would be better but diary and interview is sufficient,0,16
290,ensure to not articulate user needs as solutions or features,7,10
291,many needs are not relevant to brief,0,7
270,redundant needs written observations missing,0,5
272,needs and breakdowns not very relevant to the brief,0,9
273,excellent job looking at different hobbies,0,6
274,great descriptions of the feelings the interviewees went through,0,9
275,photo captions dont explain what kind of breakdown is shown,0,10
276,most of the needs are too general and hard to find a design opportunity in,0,15
277,cooking or food in general is an amazing cultural artifact that carries a lot of stories however i felt your observations didnt demonstrate how the cooking or the resulting food would tell a story or make someone feel and was only a factual account,0,44
278,great work with observations some of the photos didnt demonstrate a breakdown or design opportunity and some of the needs did not relate to something that could be pursued within this design project,0,33
279,i liked that you observed individuals as well as a group good needfinding,0,13
108,brainstormed only on one idea quantity is important,0,8
109,brainstorming focus on generating a diverse set of concepts not just one,0,12
102,great first interview question,0,4
103,great work but you focused in too much on your prototype reflected in your use of a computer to make it remember not to fixate too early on an idea because a better one might come along and you want to be flexible,1,43
100,prototype could be stronger and more tied to previous ideas do the preparation for them  how can you design the emails to make the students feel more like this and less like receiving your average spamuniversity email,0,37
101,good work,17,2
106,dig deeper on your point of view to help you generate more insightful ideas and prototypes also not having video questions hurt your score,1,24
107,only one worksheet submitted,0,4
104,brainstorming and sketching seem to be a strong point,0,9
105,dig a little deeper on your point of view,3,9
1372,great improvement  keep this up,0,5
1001, if i post things whats the quickest way for me to jump to those posts or display those poststheir results,0,20
1210,data dont see any significant writeadd into data capabilities in the app,0,12
1375,protocol should be documented how you should be recording things and or what to watch out for,0,17
1655,thanks a million for a great quarter,4,7
1374,also ensure use of correct statistical test chisquared ttest etc,1,10
99,great job on the assignment but your online submission doesnt contain the first worksheet from class,0,16
98,sketch could be better but gave point anyway video questions,0,10
91,well done,29,2
90,great work,23,2
93,the prototype is a little lacking in terms of giving a user that is testing a interactive experience to work with perhaps a little more integration with the email sent out is the video embedded is it a separate page,0,40
92,i like your concept of an application of doing matching work but ultimately giving the last iteration of selection to the user there can be many benefits to this,0,29
95,ensure youre completing entire assignment  no prototype present,1,8
94,also something to think about if a system is difficult when is it better to add more instructions vs redesign the system,0,22
97,prototype was good but no video questions component was added,0,10
96,nice work,53,2
1623,well done congrats on being one of the top teams,0,10
1622,walkthrough was close to 2 minutes,0,6
1621,good work throughout the whole quarter guys,3,7
1620,awesome work  ,12,2
1627,only 1 deduction presentation is unique and has creative elements that make it memorable which is not to say the presentation was bad  this point was received for the most creative presentations,1,32
1626,thank you for a wonderful quarter and great work,1,9
1625,walkthrough goes almost 2 minutes long,0,6
1624,slide doesnt show off the app show off your whiteboard ,0,10
1629,great job today its been really great seeing your team make progress on the app over the weeks and even going out and personally testing it,0,26
1377,online test plan missing all possible outcomes of the ab test are identified and interpreted with implications on the design of the prototype hypotheses are welcome what will each resulting test outcome possibility imply for the design of the app,1,40
559,nice work  strive to offer more detailed  critical feedback,0,9
558,more comparison confusion about heuristics,0,5
554,great job overall only thing is that the group evaluation did not contain many actionable suggestions for improvement,2,18
557,there was a start of a brainstorm for potential solutions to the prototypes but not an insightful conclusion reached in the aggregate feedback,11,23
556,in general not enough feedback severity rating missing,0,8
550,i liked the aggregate paragraph but it could have had more,1,11
553,good job on home page,2,5
1439,not enough photos,1,3
1199,theres no distinguishing save vs exit without saving which can confusefrustrate users,0,12
1198,the icons are all a bit confusing hide the nonfunctional ones for now also clicking on the pencil should also close the chat and return back to the whiteboard not just the chat button,0,34
1191,dev plan strikethrough to keep track of changes in tasks is nice,0,12
1190,datatemplates currently only persistent changed node session data is on vote counts as noted from things above missing a lot in other areas,0,23
1193,i like the timer functionality but it seems a bit redundant and confusing to have both a percentage scale and a timer because you focus on the timing of brushing i suggest keeping the timer clock instead maybe make it clear from the main game page that the teeth youre collecting is for your animal right now its only clear if you click the help button some of the buttons cut off in mobile form and sometimes the images dont load correctly,0,82
1192,great functionality so far its unclear what it means to fight a boss though some of the functionality in friends needs to be fleshed out as well,0,27
1195,i think perhaps a gallery view might be interesting to try rather than a single image slideshow it could also be made clear that there are multiple images the user can look through as at first glance it seems theres only one image per post,0,45
1197,a few goals were missed,1,5
1196,the navigation is still a little convoluted there are a few too many levels to go down and sometimes its hard to recover back to a previous screen such as the upcoming eventsback to group details the top banner doesnt need to take up that much space,0,47
1177,great job improving on the home page a couple things it would be nice to be able to challenge friends directly from the challenges tab when refreshing the profile page the potato skin reverts to the default,0,37
1175,in general looks like your app is pretty far along i would work on some of the things mentioned above i think priority would be getting the votes to work and then maybe being able to see my own posts,0,40
1174,data submitting things like posts and comments work well for server persistence but the voting isnt quite there i would look into post requests for that,0,26
1173,would be nice to have a way to see just my own posts,0,13
1172,can i log out,0,4
1171,notes  even some simple form validation like the required attribute for user input would be handy,0,16
1170,the home page still needs some work in terms of the mental model it would seem as though the user can click on the images below may be better to just have level progress bars without the images there also isnt a clear connection between achievements and how that relates to the pet there should also be a way to prevent users from unlocking irrelevant achievements rather than just being able to click on any of them,0,77
1179,double click sometimes doesnt work how do i delete systems,0,10
1178,very well organized dev plan but i could not figure out how to complete the task asked of me ie run around a few buildings i only seemed to be able to run around cog sci also the activity and rankings page dont seem to update based on my activity which seems to be core functionality,0,56
511,comments great storyboards your app reminded me of charity navigator httpwwwcharitynavigatororg one thing to consider is the different attitudes people may have towards donating to charity some people might want to donate a small amount regular others to build up to a larger goal over time if they—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎre not able to access a charity they want to donate to through your app they might also be inclined to give up can they set monetary goals for particular charities is money their only interaction with these charities or at least the only one that you want to support all good questions to consider second idea is simple but i like it would have liked to see a particular example of a daily challenge is there a possibility of doing something nice for another user win the app gives an incentive to the person being challenged to participate and to continue coming to the app,3,153
510,deductions  inspirations were good but  somewhat obvious would have liked to see more abstractmetaphorical connections to the point of view,0,20
513,doesnt include a concrete user need,1,6
1285,interface design fits on mobile well slightly unrelated but the changes to the way users give input via the one page form is a much better improvement from the previous iteration,0,31
1284,functionality mostly functional and not buggy enough to test out main elements filter seems to be least accounted for at the moment one part that is currently untestable is what requests to rent would end up looking like if you can get far enough to prototype that part of the exchange that would be pretty cool would also check out the list of improvements in the above,0,67
1287,notes  new header and things way better than the transparent nice,0,11
512,deductions  doesnt explicitly relate to design brief,1,7
1281,nav bar icon inconsistent on leftright and sometimes missing,0,9
1283, filter options not obvious the cogs button thing i actually didnt realize that was a thing until i was snooping around the repo code  also not clear how to utilize the filter does it work wheres the actionable okay filter now button,0,42
1282, form validation would be nice for input  that part is def going to be usedtested by people,0,17
1003,he changes interesting dialogue approach with the he evaluations fun to read might be useful later to condense this into a concise list just so its easier to keep track of for changes in the future,0,36
879,revisiting the brief is good incorporation of the 5stage model but missing more detail about actual changes the second paragraph helped with that a good amount though still more concrete changes need to be identified and made,0,37
1289,functionality still a couple bugs and perhaps not quite completely ready for testing once you get all this api madness finalized would ideally like to see some other tier of functionality involved in the application i think what would really encourage some additional exchange to happen would be what i noted above about being able to see who has checked in when like a nice aggregate of all this information with your list viewrandom or something that way i might be interested in chatting up someone who had been somewhere recently and getting their opinions something like that would be nice  some concrete data that people would actually be pretty interested to see,0,113
1288,breaks when i click a location point and try to click the name of the place from the text bubble,0,20
514,inspiration board is good but explanations lack depth a simple interface may be good for one particular application but you should delve deeper into why the interface is good,0,29
1579,deductions   presentation is unique and has creative elements that make it memorable,6,12
689,group he great insight on the security aspect of messaging involving consent,2,12
688,home page nice start to your home screen some things to consider once a user is either renting something out searching for things looking to rent etc should their home portal show different things rather is choosing between renting out things and renting from others going to most likely be the page someone wants to see by default this can all depend a lot on how users behave maybe most people will only either be mainly a buyer or mainly a renter maybe most people will live in both realms probably not hugely important but something to think about if you want to ensure that first page contains the best value for users,2,113
685,home page good start make sure you start considering a number of the heuristics covered in the last assignment at first glance its hard to determine what exactly i should be doing at a user if its a button make sure its obvious its a button if i hadnt already been brief with the prototypes from previous assignments i wouldnt have noticed that the two bottom boxes are the main functional buttons recognition over recall will be a big one for this screen,2,83
684,group he solid distilling of major errors solutions are pretty generic though perhaps some deeper discussion on solutions that would really fit well into the overall design of the prototypes could be more useful to address the ending note i agree that he can often draw away from the evaluation of the idea of an application needspov etc he mostly concerns usability but it is true that at this level of prototyping a little more consideration  given to the idea would be very valuable if we had more time in the course we would definitely love to fit in some more needsidea evaluation,2,103
686,missing some feedback that compares the two prototypes beyond just nothing that both are missing the same thing,0,18
681,home screen needs to layout the skeleton for more features can the user see past likesdislikes im hoping there will be more features than just likedislike in your final app,2,30
680,not enough quantity of feedback in general feedback needed to highlight the differences between the prototypes better and in some cases were too similar,0,24
683,individual he very thorough and well organized good job great job drawing comparisons in the prototypes as well,3,18
458,your point of view needs to be human centered why are people interested in sharing more aspects of themselves,0,19
1226,functionality  just missing a bit more functionality to complete the flow id like to be able to sign up and login as another user to check out the question i just posted on superuser etc,0,35
621,good job overall only thing missing was an explicit comparative analysis between the two prototypes,2,15
1224,whatever we talked about in office hour about potential navigation restructure consider when you have time,0,16
1223,if closing questions is an option should add that in for my questions,0,13
1222,on that note is answered and unanswered supposed to represent my personal participation in the question like whether or not i personally answered it thats what im guessing after seeing it change from yellow to green after answering but not quite w,0,42
1221,notes  labeling what each symbol means works though im wondering now if you just instead of having the symbols literally write unanswered in a small yellow box inline with the text etc  if that would work even better,0,38
1220,how is the distribution of hours going seems a bit uneven  can you add a total actual hours for each person to your spreadsheet  the time that your group meets,0,30
407,be careful about creating something like tinder for ucsd as this has been done over and over again your pov included social anxiety and i think your storyboards and prototypes should more address the social anxiety aspect rather than simply being an app to find connections or friends think of some other game elements that you might be able to incorporate into a social app like this,0,67
406,overall i think the idea of provoking honest feedbackcriticism between people is a great design problem would love to see how this turns out and how you can make it work the specific market of fashion critique is a great place to start appearances are probably something that people think about all the time,0,54
405,storyboard 2 for storyboards you really want to focus on the users experience when using your potential solution its not quite clear in storyboard 2 how the engagement of the application affects your user there seems to be a lot more heavily focused on the problem there should be a good balance,0,52
404,pov good articulation of strategy and issue of honest communication can we condense this a little bit more think about if you had only 1015 seconds to pitch your pov to someone what would you say this will be useful to know moving forward,0,44
403,inspirations needs more insightful explanation on why these choices are inspirations this section is not just a list of other products and what features they have the tinder bullet might be the closest to addressing this but still lacks depth in what about this particular matchmaking system inspires you or offers some insightful takeaway,0,54
402,the prototypes could be more divergent otherwise everything is looking good,0,11
401,for photo sharing have you seen lensmob httphcistorystudiotumblrcompost109129576225lensmob,1,8
400,i like the juxtaposition of artifacts as conveying meaning but elaborate further and specifically talk about what kind of meaning,0,20
1379,protocol really fantastic protocol well detailed and takes care of a lot of variables like choosing what to fill out which task to do etc i love that you did a pilot study and documented it as well great stuff,0,40
1378,as far as variable measuring the one thing i would be concerned about is your original prototype also contains a search icon will you measure that too how will you distill results if you do just make sure you are aware of that potential muddling of data,0,47
1342,no description of the possible outcomes of an ab test,1,10
409,inspiration a lot of fantastic discussion on particular interface features and interactive elements would like to see some more commentary on some higher level inspiration related to your pov on your own time spend a few thinking about some other applicationssystems that might inspire you in that area,0,48
408,pov the core user need can be clearer in this point of view just learning described as a daunting task nor pointing out the potential useful need of peer experts is quite concretely demonstrating a user need,0,37
453,the first prototype doesnt show enough interaction for me to understand how its implemented especially the last screen is unclear,0,20
454,your point of view needs to explain more what about their formatting causes them to fall short how are their communication channels limited,0,23
455,i like the connection to the anonymityyik yak and communityquora that you guys make beware that those two are often at odds with each other,0,25
1346,deductions no quantifiable measure listed,0,5
379,observations would like to see more clarity in the breakdowns of the 3rd observation zhen  marco,0,16
378,good job on distilling some interesting needs from the information system that exists within school i thought it was an insightful perspective that customers should not be the middle communicator for such office systems,0,34
371,all photos missing captions,1,4
370, observation section could be a more clear in demonstrating breakdownsdesign opportunties needs are supposed to be generated from breakdownsopporutnites,0,19
373,a lot of needs are way too specific to be relevant enough to the activity to warrant a design project ex needs to find a baking soda replacement additionally some redundancy in the list of needs,0,36
372,there should be no solutionsfeatures to solve needs,0,8
375,interesting insight that impromptu scheduling seems to be more successful than nonimpromptu,0,12
374,needs a lot of these are unrelated to the activities that you observed a lot of these needs also fall into the same category of simply making a decision between a and b what else do people need in the exchange of informationopinions to make a decision besides just changing what a and b are,0,55
377,"to	use	it	to	make	her	notsospontaneous	trips	with	others	successful as	well",0,2
376,"needs some needs are too vague to be churned into a design project ex alex	needs	a	way	to	take	what	makes	her	spontaneous trips	with	others	successful	and",0,16
393,both storyboard 1 and 2 have a good setup but dont show how the user reaches satisfaction in the end taking point off only from storyboard 2,0,27
392,how does your inspiration inspire yourelate to the point of viewmake peoples expressions more empathetic online how do they succeed where do they fail,0,24
391,didnt give talk never reminded me,0,6
390,definitely the needs are straying from a personal informatics brief gave credit anyway but its easy to see how you went astray early on thankfully i think were more on track,0,31
397,the second prototype doesnt show me a clear interaction with the prototype,0,12
396,talk more critically about what the mentioned inspirations lack and how you might solve that particular aspect no points deducted,1,20
395,your point of view seems to point in a direction but im not sure what its trying to solve a more explicit need needs to be mentioned for example,0,29
394,also a prototype is nonobvious as the solution is missing,0,10
399,many of the inspirations dont explain exactly how it relates to your point of view movie or interactive theater is way too broad of a category explain better how you might improve on these existing inspirations or how they fall short,0,41
398,your introduction explains your point of view better than your point of view section,0,14
895,development plan wellthought out and organized you will want to add in the dates of your outside constraints so your team knows exactly when those external factors will affect your progress,0,31
245,your point a modern community should allocate more space by integrating various facilities into single edifices or in proximate areas to promote activity such as taller buildings is not a usergenerated need ensure that you are not framing needs as solutions or features,0,43
244,for your first user scannable by evernote is helpful,0,9
246,lastly photo captions do not articulate breakdowns,1,7
241,photos not very clearly indicated how some of these photos are linked to the particular 3 observations that you made make sure that the captions provide enough detail for that is hannah involved in one of these photos etc,0,39
240,parking a longstanding problem that could definitely use some design improvement i think it was good that you observed a good variety of breakdowns from highlevel locating to interfacelevel issues,0,30
243,for armando it isnt quite clear from the observation writing where the breakdown design opportunity is everything seems to be going well for him and no issues are brought up what went wrong with his methods of dividing tasks in his activities,0,42
242,needs a number of redundancies in these needs that could easily be squashed into fewer needs could dig deeper into the core motiviations of those involving in this parking system exchange,0,31
248,first photos caption does not articulate a breakdown,2,8
179,ensure that you are not articulating needs as solutions or features eg jason needs an app that can help him find activity for him,1,24
177,very thorough your needs were articulated more as features though be careful about being too solutionfocused in this first step,0,20
176,your ideas and topic are very interesting but the sketches submitted demonstrated features or solutions they should show users in the situation and the breakdowns in that situation,0,28
175,needs some redundancieslack of relevance in needs,3,7
174,observations no discussion of what the activity isrelation to brief in general missing a lot of substance regarding breakdownsopportunities for design distilled from observation not very clear what exactly is being observed and what you observed was a breakdownopportunity while interviewing is also an important role in needfinding watching and observing breakdowns rather than only listening to what they have to say about their problems is a major part of this assignment did the lack of nicely designed signs hinder alon in his activity does diana make mistakes in ordering because of calorie concerns these are examples of potential breakdowns that would be important to watch out for,0,108
173,well done great job finding a diverse set of participants with meetings involving members with varying levels of commitment a core problem with many different possible breakdowns,0,27
171,fantastic job with the organization of your assignment most of the breakdowns you observed seemed to revolve around reminders which does make sense i would have been interesting to see if there are any parts of the whole exchange that could yield interesting insights for example even the decision stage at a restaurant table when people try to organize payments could be interesting in a longer span it could also be interesting to see how much people pay each other back in a mutual fashion would we really need to exchange money all the time if were always paying for each other of course not possible with the time scope of this assignment but something interesting to think about,0,119
170,needs a number of redundancies in needs listed,2,8
1502,deductions 1 point off for your statistical analysis conclusions  your chisquared statistic is 08333 your pvalue is 0361 which is not statistically significant to the p 05 level which is what we required for this assignment that means your ab test did not nullify your results,0,46
1503,some issues of polish remain specifically on the add savingscategories page,0,11
1500,still confused about what to do prima facie,0,8
1367,the dev plan is borderline passing for these points it has not been updated well in terms of added times or including all tasks that were done it also appears that teamwork is not evenly distributed spend a few extra minutes fixing the dev plan and updating for both a9 and a10 or you will lose points in the future last warning on dev plan,0,65
1227,in general everything is mostly functional  nice work there only small kink at the moment still is being able to have multiple users testing the app at once  i think you really want to focus on interaction flow now think about all the cases where users will want to do things,0,51
659,home screen the goal list is off center from the buttons when your homescreen is viewed on the desktop when viewed on a mobile device the logout button overlaps the with your logo and the lower three buttons become stacked remember that youre developing a mobile web app your home screen should be developed accordingly,3,55
1619,pitch was awesome  great work  ,3,5
1617,nice pitch just not creative excellent poster great walkthrough,0,9
1615,nice work on pitch could have been better rehearsed nice poster walkthrough is twice as long as allowed,0,18
1612,considering you only had 2 teammates i think your app came together best out of both studios good work pitch was great poster was nice walkthrough well done,0,28
1613,well done thank you for a great quarter  good luck on any remaining finals,0,14
1610,enjoyed having the three of you in studio great to see your app develop over the quarter needed a little more practice on the walkthrough today and also looking for a little more on the point of view about helping students reflect on their priorities and time use the key idea was there but just needed a little more fleshing out in the app,0,64
1611,the feedback loop on the slide saved it using blackgray against dark green wasnt a good idea decent poster nice walkthrough,0,21
1142,mostly there just needing to flesh out the rest of the functionality employee dashboard,0,14
1143,the app needed a lot of progress at this time but i remember it worked at least on device mode and phone,0,22
1140,great functionality eveything is mostly all there there are still some unanswered things like what happens when your friendler levels up why does it matter to check in with friends vs checking in alone,0,34
1141,great progress this week the only point off is because i dont think the add assignment page has the ia you want for a mobile app as we discussed in class,0,31
1146,overall you look ready for testing just looks like you did not fully update your dev plan to reflect your progress this week,0,23
1147,less detail more big picture core functionality,0,7
1144,the visual design is great but there still needs to be a way to know what exactly it takes to earn more tastebuddies great functionality so far,0,27
1145,nice job,1,2
1148,the interface is still not very intuitive not enough progress,0,10
1149,plan is not easy to read and links dont work task sentence isnt a task its instructions on what buttons to press,0,22
692,individual he overall good analysis and organized he really nice catch and observation on the spelling for keyword matched voting that would definitely break the system,0,26
693,group he way too focused on feature additions to the app and less so on usability should be more oriented toward distilling important usability heuristic violations from all individual hes and providing some potential solutions,2,35
690,missing severity ratings,0,3
696,some of the heuristics were more featurefocused rather than usability focused for this step you want to make sure to comment on the functionality rather than the details of the features the group evaluation for the 2nd prototype is lacking more actionable suggestions for improvement,2,45
697,severity is having a help page really severity level 4 this was the only level 4 you listed  but i would say a lot of the usability issues you mentioned are much more important and not having a standalone help page isnt probably catastrophic to app functionality,0,47
694,missing link pulled it from your other teammates ,0,8
695,home page good start unclear what the iconbutton up at the top right is used for so you may want to work on clarifying that,2,25
699,home page good start one thing to consider moving forward is what users would like to see on their first functional home page would they prefer a list of all colleges when you provide a search anyway or perhaps a list of the colleges they are currently followingmost interested in its also not quite obvious what the difference between your home selection and schools selection is at the current point in time in general if you decide to have users create their own personalized list youll want to distinguish between your schools and schools overall,2,95
1548,still needs some work its not clear what the app does prima facie,0,13
1549,online test results nice clean report,0,6
542,the point of view is too specific with its problem and doesnt explain why personal informatics are important to solving this problem i think your group is on the right track but the point of view you wrote here is not connected very well to the brief this needs to be clear for your benefit,0,55
543,look in places you otherwise might not look for inspiration reach as far as you can for inspiration,0,18
540,comments recommend not tying yourself to one extremely outdated device when developing your prototypes,0,14
541,is there any way that your app might pull information from online sources to make entering requirements less tedious,0,19
546,nice work good comparative analysis and feedback,0,7
544,good storyboards good prototypes,0,4
545,this assignment is incomplete  ensure youre reading the assignment description  rubric in detail before submitting,0,15
414,look  prototype requirements presents an interface at a sketch level,0,10
415,pov i think this pov is getting close but could be honed down a little closer to the concrete need addressed particularly in responding to the impersonaldegrading aspect of asking for favors what do users actually need for this to not be a problem just a provided hub for this may not be enough to clarify this design space there are many hubs and possibilities for hubs what is your point of view on what needs to exist in this space,0,81
416,explain about how your inspirations fall short of solving your problem,0,11
417,good job i really like the metaphor of the timer in the first prototype,0,14
410,prototypes for the scans you should show some steps indicating a flow that takes a user through the application otherwise someone looking would not be able to distill the proper interactions from the prototype and create a functional application,0,39
411,in general its also a little difficult to distill the critical highlevel design differences between the two prototypes they both seem pretty centered around a lookup of people teaching certain subjects and the ability to initiate some conversation considering some different designs to address your pov can greatly help with the iterative process try to spend some time thinking about on your own time this will also help you figure out exactly what core feature makes your final app what it is,0,82
412,the food app has been done many time before  what new dimension will you bring to the table,6,18
413,sketch was wonderful but too detailed sketch is supposed to take 10 minutes as stated in rubric for a2 also refer to class slides,0,24
1384,these are leading questions how could you reword them in order for them not to be,0,16
1385,users thought that the roll button was kind of buried at the bottom making it less appealing when the page first loads  this is not a change to be made  one way to check if youre starting with a verb or more action oriented verbiage,0,45
1386,pending  this is confusing how to know what exactly is pending  is it just a lag in connection is it a users invite is pending their acceptance please add clarification,0,30
418,pov not clear where the core user need is in this pov that points toward the design space looking for different food  snack options is a very broad area as is giving information  opportunities to find better meal options what is it in particular in your point of view that you think students need to successfully engage in the exchange of food,0,62
419,inspiration really good analysis of inspiration a lot of valuable insight,0,11
1382,do they think that the menu button is too small how can we help make it more,0,17
1383,accessible do the users think that the color synergy plays well together   how do they like the flow of the application ,0,21
368,in general you want to follow the instructionsrubric of assignments you missed a lot of things and did a lot of things wrong that could have been avoided by following the doc,0,32
369,explanation on relation to brief,0,5
366,photos 2  3 no clear connection to a breakdowndesign opportunity just captioned general scenes,0,14
364,talk overtime,0,2
365,observations needs more clarity on exactly where the breakdowns  design opportunities are occurring for example bridgets main activity would have been taking the alternative route in attempting to engage in exchange with local experts what happened in this process that you observed what things hinderedhelped her along the way,0,49
362,photo 1 michelle no clear demonstration of breakdownsopportunites,0,8
363,needs  a number of redundancies in the list ex needing to be able to utilize colloquial phrases better,0,18
360,needs some of these needs were redundant and could have been squashed down into fewer one of the things to watch out for mostly because of the nature of what you observed is to not fall too deep into generating too many needs that are interface specific remember to take a step back and think about the activity as a whole the users experience their core motivations and ultimately what they need and how that can be the basis for some interesting design projects,0,84
361,very interesting choice of topic and great diversity in activities chosen i found that the most insightful observations that you made were in your 3rd section with the natural interative setting between leo  mikey where you brought up the design opportunity that learning together is fun i would have liked to see more of this type of oberservation in your other sections often times its whats done that can speak even louder than what is said,0,76
381,very interesting discussion of habit being an inhibitor to novelty also interesting was the perspective of work interrupting entertainment rather than the more common version of entertainment distracting from work,0,30
382,needs some redundancy in needs ex efficient discovery of appealing content,0,11
383,be careful not to focus on the solution too much the first photo provided was more solution focused than demonstrating a breakdown some of the needs listed were also more featurefocused also in your observations rather than noting how theyre parking think about how parallel parking is affecting them ie were they stressed were they afraid etc,0,57
384,your pictures did not make the breakdowndesign opportunity clear your needs were written as things that the user wants not needs also they were often written as  features  eg user wants a confirm alert where you should be talking about the underlying need that a confirm alert is trying to address why does the user want a confirm alert the need there is to avoid making an error,0,68
385,two of your breakdowns were very general  they sounded more like a restatement of the challenges of dieting than an example of exactly how a diet goes off course,0,29
386,the only point you lost was for not clearly demonstrating design opportunitiesbreakdowns in your submission your interviews were written up describing what the people you interviewed said without focusing on the actions they took and your own evaluation of the content of their statements its important when doing needfinding to go deeper into what people do by digging deeper into the answers that people give you in addition to listening,0,70
387,ensure that you are not articulating user needs as solutions or features  that the photo captions also express breakdowns,6,19
388,hoa i added the point that we talked about,0,9
389,missing photossketches for each observation observations should be more comprehensive and demonstrate a clear user breakdown and should be explicitly linked to the studio brief needs were more solutionfocused rather than userfocused this assignment is more about understanding the user and what the user might need rather than the app they might use did not dock points for presenting in studio since you entered the class after this assignment was due,0,71
258,the topic and ideas are great be careful not to become too invovled during observations you want to observe as if youre an outsider,0,24
259,the topic is interesting but needs to be more explicitly related to the studio brief also only 2 participants were observed,0,21
252,since you chose different types of users to observe a comparison or commonality of breakdowns between them wouldve been exciting to point out,0,23
250,i am one of those people that uses a dslr while carrying many lenses if you want to see a particular setup that has worked for me and the design thoughts that went into it let me know and i can share it during office hours,0,46
251,the observations and photoscaptions should explicitly make clear where a breakdown appeared a factual account is not an interesting observation,0,20
256,good job on insightful breakdown observations,0,6
257,great topic and great job,8,5
254,excellent job really insightful observations in different situations,0,8
255,a few of the needs listed are not quite as relevant to your activity of group discussion,0,17
1679,great job today definitely enjoyed how frank the pitch was i think the audience got a kick out of it too p well done with everything,0,26
168,photo 2 no clear demonstration of breakdowndesign opportunity,1,8
169,photo 3 same thing,0,4
164,as a longstanding method of spreading awareness flyering definitely has room for interesting design improvements it was good that you observed different aspects of the flyering process from the conversation to the travel of the physical handout,0,37
165,observations no description of activity and its relation to brief,0,10
166,needs a number of needs that you generated do not seem relevant to the activity that you observed nor the breakdowns that you found,0,24
167,observations commentary here could be more clear on what breakdownsdesign opportunities you found while observing activities you mention a lot of he saidshe said but not much of really detailing particular things that actually happened while you were watching it can help a lot in these cases to be more specific as you watched person x perform activity y z happened when they tried to achieve abc etc,0,68
160,great work a couple of your needs are more features than needs other than that great,0,16
161,as we discussed this is a very important and serious topic that being said ensure that you are able to fully complete the learning goals of the course within the prope scope  eg these observations are based on your interviewees observations where the assignment specifically wanted you to conduct the observations if the grandiose nature of this topic means you will not be able to fully complete the learning goals i would strive to find ways of scaling down the topic or finding communities in your immediate environment eg refugees coming toin san diego in order to ensure you are reaching the learning goals in this course questions come to office hours,1,112
679,some of the violations and compartive analyses listed could have been explained in greater detail good job overall,0,18
670,ensure following directions  submitting in pdf format,2,7
671,the other category shouldnt exist  these should be categorized within the heuristics for example  there is no progress report at the end of 21 days which summarizes the completion number of missed days continuity streak for each activity 3  this would be considered flexibility and efficiency of use a regular user of this app would expect some sort of reportingstatus update and this is not a use case supported in the current prototype,0,73
1609,many of the points you did not get stemmed from not having a clear or insightful pov your pov seemed to be that people lack data about electricity usage but why do they lack data what is the barrier to collection i dont think its just because they dont have an app,0,52
1608,great to see a very well implemented app,0,8
1601,slide is cluttered and doesnt show off the application interface,0,10
1600,poster missing competitive analysis,2,4
1603,great job this quarter,8,4
1602,walkthrough should introduce the application with its goalpov,0,8
1605,the visual layout of the poster is well executed has no filler content and is aesthetically pleasing,2,17
1606,poster demonstrates how the app provides a solution to a problem that is differentbetter than other solutions,4,17
808,home screen the view requirements button on the home screen is ambiguous what am i supposed to see when i click that button it would be nice to have an indication of which quarters have been completed and which remain in the table shown seems like something that could be easily done with color choice also what happens when i click the graduation button if these arent meant to be treated as buttons then i would suggest changing their style especially given that they belong the class btndanger,0,88
803,deductions  total number of violations found was under 15,0,9
802,appreciated your use of a table for formatting,0,8
801,overall well done small deductions for the potential solutions provided they address the issues found but not necessarily in a creative or insightful way  popups can be obtrusive layout and wording are also important considerations for addressing problems with clarity,1,40
800,home screen navigational flow seems unclear do i need to signin before i can user your app the host and guest buttons seem to indicate no the my events button seems to indicate that im already signed in when did i do that am i just redirected to a signin button when i click there,1,55
807,well done 1 point off for a solution that is somewhat obvious and only addresses one of the many issues highlighted with the app,0,24
805,minimal solutions provided for usability issues found,0,7
804,minimal comparison between two apps in individual heuristic feedback,0,9
1159,very nicely done so far i like the concept of heroes and villains and working together to earn points i think the homepage could still use some work with understanding how the powerupp button works maybe having it faded out until the user selects a work out will make it more clear when and why they should press it,0,59
1158,data missing significant write capability a lot of json reading but not much if any pushing into or editing memorydata,0,20
1155,currently no real way of handling login even a simple json pushcheck would suffice i dont want to have to login again everytime i click the pierre logo,0,28
1154,form validation,1,2
1157,functionality functionality still pretty jagged and buggy layout and connection is all there but actual working parts not quite there yet it looks like youve gotten started in working on all of that notes on your progress so far as of monday are above as of 219 though not quite ready for user testing,0,54
1156, work on functionality as much as possible,0,7
1150,unclear what r stands for nor the blue highlight vs not pink heart could be more obvious,0,17
1153, having another page to fill stuff out after pressing create account is also pretty unexpected,0,15
1152,notes as of 222 prototype not the 219 graded one  showing the password in the password field is pretty unexpected,0,20
1555,you guys have done a lot of great work on this app i had to take a point off for the polish and ready to present im sure youre focusing on it for the final presentations but it does make a big difference that the calendar isnt working i also know its very close to the deadline but you might consider for demo purposes wizard of ozing the typical interaction for receiving an event after setting up so instead of taking until 10 pm have a wait time of 10 seconds and then display the event on the recent page,0,100
1554,great work this week one issue i didnt see described in the list of revisions is the fact that the  piggy closet page is not connected to any other page the hamburger menu doesnt link back to the main screen the one thing that would add the final bit of polish would be to give some sort of indication on the dashboard as to how many piggy points i have how long until i accrue more etc being reminded of the piggy points increases the motivation to actually interact w the piggy 1 point off because the closet screen not being completely connected is a polish issue and ought to be fixed before the demo,8,115
1551,overall awesome progress super cool seeing people who have been to the places not only in the random roll but also when clicking on a marker in the map nice work list view and individual view could still be polished up a bit in terms of style but its looking pretty demoable to me,0,54
1550,missing github link  ,1,3
1553,great job on the functionality and i look forward to hearing your pitch,0,13
1552,i feel that you should also test for the core functionality of the  app ie the trading card part or the reroll part as these are essential for your app some other possible revisions for different portions of your ui should also be addressed you may also want to think about how the chore cards should be displayed rather than scrolling through 10 chores,0,64
59,appreciate the humor but use that effort for going deeper good job regardless,0,13
58,well done just missing video questions,5,6
1557,2 deductions   your development plans dont have weeks 58 or week 10 ive been pretty lax on grading these but i have to take a point off for this,0,29
1556,i would recommend for the demo on friday to focus on having navigation working properly it looks like in the version im looking at now theres something janky going on w sessions possibly due to facebook login but i keep getting redirected to the login screen i would also avoid saying  your system isnt under maintenance too honest instead youre offering me the convenience of signing in w facebook yay   itd be a good idea have 1 wizard of ozed sequence of screens for demo purposes,0,86
55,directions were to fill out worksheet packet twice despite this your work is really well done questions also missing,0,19
54,well done interesting approach with a more specific problem that if solved can lead to better experiences overall for freshman,0,20
56,treated sketch as prototype,0,4
53,brainstorming focus on generating a diverse set of concepts rather than worrying too much about laying out the details of few potential solutions,2,23
52,ensure you complete entire assignment  no prototypes present,1,8
537,prototype 2 has a lot of screens but was difficult to figure out and seems to be for the incorrect platform,0,21
536,storyboards focus too heavily on the prototypeui need to be able to come up with a distinct prototype that corresponds to the point of view from the storyboard,0,28
535,inspiration board doenst talk about how the user would currently address their need and why it falls short,0,18
534,deductions,0,1
533,comments really liked your inspiration board your prototype was really well thought out but at times especially the first one was very busy for the second prototype you might want to consider not sending regular summary notifications to users and not asking them initially how often they want to be contacted because that—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎs not something they will necessarily know right off the bat another thing to consider is how you can make the gamification aspect of your app intuitive but not timeconsuming if you—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎve  seen the app neko atsume you see that it—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎs a game that doesn—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎt require that users spend a lot of time using it but that has managed to get people to keep coming back this is a balance that you could try to strike with the piggy game dressing up the pig is a cute idea maybe other activities than simply saving money can accrue rewards,0,150
532,comments your approach feels very generic you might run into the risk of trying to solve too many problems at once and not really doing any one thing well focus on narrowing down your point of viewtry thinking back to personas see scott—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎs videos from week 2 and developing one or two example users for your app  i like the idea for the second app because it—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎs more clearly intended for a shy person who wants to make friends but needs a way to overcome their shyness,0,87
531, storyboard 1 i should be able to make a distinct prototype from the one your team made based off of this storyboard but it already includes a view of the specific interface,0,32
530,inspiration didnt make abstractmetaphorical connections to point of view,0,9
539,deductions  point of view doesnt specifically engage the brief,0,9
538,comments second prototype was very difficult to read also seems to be made for a desktop view not a mobile web app i like your idea of specifically helping cs students develop their portfolios i think it—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎs time to do more needfinding have you talked to people who are actively working on projects i think the second idea has a lot of potential but right now is confusing and not quite clear is this a portal for tracking work for applying to jobs for viewing others websites,0,87
1558,prototype is lacking in final polish,0,6
429,rather than focusing on studying is boring perhaps think of why traditional studying is ineffective and why students struggle with it inspiration board should include more screenshots to make a more direct link between that inspiration and your prototype in your storyboards you also include the teacher which is not stated in your pov and was difficult to follow the sequencing many groups have made study apps in the past so think about how you might mae yours more innovative and outofthebox than simply a study app,0,87
428,overall i think youre on track however id encourage you to articulate a clearer pov that is more closely tied to the issues your raise with exploration or being in a certain place at a certain time note that these are two different needs and you should select one of them to focus on,0,54
1399,observations very important insight found about the keyboard blocking normal interaction flow that you wouldnt normally be a problem on a desktop great detail overall,0,25
1398,dont overlook the difficulty people may have with writing down their appliances watt usage this may be a point where people get frustrated and leave your app also was looking for a clearer description of your ab testing including metrics and potential outcomes,0,43
421,inspiration not very inspiring good enough idea but im not seeing much creativity,0,13
420,in the second prototype the idea of ratinglisting by menu items rather than general eateries is great its definitely another angle to take that has a huge effect on the experience of exchanging information about food perhaps theres a way to kill two birds with one stone here finding where to eat and what to eat in one motion,0,59
423,storyboard 2s doesnt directly lead to a prototype,0,8
422,inspirations should demonstrate critical thinking by explaining how those articlesapps fall short or what other questions they lead to,0,19
425,good work overall most of my pertinent feedback was given during studio  in office hours,0,15
424,the novelly idea is fun to think about i would think about talking with potential users more especially users who are writers and see how they might react to such a situation,0,32
427,i really liked your prototypes and storyboards great job at putting a unique twist on traditional productivity apps,0,18
426,main takeaway would be to focus on distilling one key feature that makes your app what it is this will help tremendously in moving forward with the design process,0,29
229,clear but the scope of social collaboration can be broadened a bit rather than just only within games,0,18
228,your observations were of college students but your needs mentioned young kids make sure your needs address the population you observed some needs were slightly redundant your sketches and captions better described the breakdowns than your description of the observations,0,40
227,sketch captions dont describe the breakdown or design opportunity i liked the organization of your user needs,0,17
226,needs some redundancies in needs some lacking detail to become a basis for a design project,0,16
224,big problem space that will probably be relevant for a long time good diversity in observations looking at multiple angles of the exchange,0,23
222,observations could be a little bit more clear on where breakdownsopportunities are occurring in some of your observations ex are there instances where brian slips while going about the normal routine of correcting differences did any mishaps happen when trying to recall routine fro memory,0,45
221,good choices of activities to observe regarding student organizations particularly interesting how much memory is involved in activities 1  2 from counting votes to teaching routines taking care of memory issues is always an opportunity for design in technology,0,39
220,photo  3 could have more clarity on the breakdown is it just lack of knowledge where does this user slip has he shown indication of trying to find other musicians which part of that along the way give slight to this breakdown,0,42
151,nice work  it could also be interesting to interview someone on the other side of the event planning equation eg an event goer  what is their threshold for attending an event,0,31
150,was looking for a few more photos highlighting breakdowns,0,9
153,be more clear about your breakdowns and opportunities,0,8
155,observations there isnt a very clear description of what particular activity you were observing the main detail mentioned is only what kinds of questions you asked in the interviews i would have liked to see more insight on the things observed while you were watching your participants,0,47
154,very thorough great job,6,4
157,observations could be more clear on where exactly the breakdownsdesign opportunities are asking whether or not they would be willing to exchange for food recipes and cooking lessons is a leading question and does necessarily give reliable insight on opportunities for design,0,42
156,needs a number of redundancies needs that arent particularly critical enough to warrant a design project we want to really think about what was observed and what motivations would drive peoples actions in the activity you observed,0,37
158,photo 2 does not have a clear breakdowndesign opportunity just describes how dan goes about his routine,0,17
1524,cool logo everything themes pretty well and gives off the right feeling for what kind of people this app caters to,0,21
1544,test results surprising results are always fun though this is not to say at this moment we are able to really claim one is comprehensively better over the other somewhere down the line there may be other content youd want to fit in an upper header which would necessitate moving category navigation into the side menu etc it was good that your team had a fallback to user feedback for making design decisions in this project scope,0,77
1525,test results nice process  organization good to see that with more tests you were able to come to a more confident result also great touch with keeping track of additional variables for back your findings,0,35
1526,list of changes good list very useful to have context for the changes listed alongside the actual proposed change,0,19
818,i cant gleam the features that novelly will have from your home screen,2,13
1527,good job overall new navigation between question tabs seems to work really well will there be any plans to actually allow someone to make an account and login would be nice to be able to actually mess around with questions that users generate  currently it wont let me create an account and persistently says password fields do not match  ,0,59
810,home screen very well developed remember youre designing a mobile web app so you should be optimizing for that view when i view your home screen as a mobile app the piggy jr view has overlapping buttons and is unclear also you have two tiers of toplevel navigation which takes up a lot of screen real estate in the mobile view how many of those buttons do users actually need immediate access to try looking into additionalalternative ways to do navigation,2,81
811,individual he fantastic analysis of usability well organized with useful comparisons drawn between the different prototypes very easy to read well done,0,22
812,group he good flow from highlevel issues down to very specific usability issues potential solutions offered are reasonable providing specific examples in the prototypes of broader reaching usability errors is very useful especially for the team who was evaluated,2,39
813,home page good start something to consider based on your current page theres a lot of space left an example not necessarily what you should do is it necessary to take an extra step to jump to a list of clubs for example you might just simply start listing clubs with the hero action to start matching up at a location thats always visible bring this up in a team discussion of what exactly you would like your user to see as a default maybe always having to choose between two options by default is a hassle and you can replace that space with something more useful,2,107
814,i liked that the feedback was placed side by side  very useful,0,12
815, your severity ratings were too light most of the severity 1 violations were severity 2 or 3 at minimum,0,19
816,potential solutions provided were minimal would have liked to see more,0,11
1545,nice week 10 stretch goal,0,5
1522,list of changes red  green change on the photo upload is a lot more noticeable now nice,0,17
1523,fit and finish uploaded a brian soe as a tent i would include a header also on the specific listing page it still feels a little inconsistent to only have the option to use the browser integrated back to get out of the page where as all other pages have a navigation system,0,53
1397, a smarter and more relevant search with fewer questions only city and date will be implemented  the purpose of an ab test is to work past what we think is intuitive or smarter as discussed in class these inclinations are often wrong,0,42
1492,app looks in good shape and you scoped your ab test well to answer a basic but meaningful question only points not given were for not updating the dev plan to say more specifically what you will do this week a lot of steps go into making a good poster and you did not put in your dev plan what changes you would make based on your ab test,0,69
1493,no statistical information provided no updated dev plan,0,8
1494,as you noted your chisquare test was a stretch so you havent earned those points if you have time you may want to add another question type or two,0,29
1495,in this iteration it seemed that the cookies functionality wasnt working the pets also dont seem to animate on the home page they were so cute the pictures in the gallery also didnt load correctly when i tested on my phone and in device mode on chrome otherwise great job so far i think your concept is very cute and creative looking forward to your presentation,0,66
1496,good work so far on your visual design and functionality looking forward to your presentation,1,15
1396,notes original design url and redesign url are submitted the redesign is functional  redesign is not fully functional  ensure this is before you complete used testing 1 when click refine user previous search queries are not carried over so as is its currently just starting a new search 2 filter doesnt actually filter based on inputted queries,0,57
1498,your expected is your before redesign and your observed is after redesign your chisquared calculations are done incorrectly,0,18
1499,please include full dev plan in pdf or link to full dev plan i cant compare with just the given,0,20
1700,great job love the publicizing posts,0,6
1702,great work on the ec assignments the only thing is the video could have been more appealing by walking through a scenario in which a user would use the app in real life rather than walking through its features,0,39
1394,the photos show and the captions thoroughly describe clear breakdowns or opportunities  some of the user breakdowns were due to a lack of functionality not a violation of neilsens heuristics etc,0,31
1704,video was very entertaining glad to see arvind learned how to properly slice vegetables haha,0,15
1705,great job on the ec assignments only thing missing was evidence of users using the app would be nice to include a google analytics page of usage or of the database of users,1,33
1392,ensure redesign is fully functional in order for users to not get caught up parsing bugs,0,16
1391,great work  specifically the user interviews observations insights gathered,0,9
1390,really push these next couple weeks looking forward to seeing how things shape up,0,14
1128,app things in the next week really focus on bringing out whatever key features you believe to make your app what it is soon youll be testing that out with real live users a wonderful task as a user with wizard of ozed data to complete would be filling out a profile with interests playing with the match making system finding out some awesome info and having the org information ready to go from that point forward you have that basic flow existing already but now is the time to get it all feeling as real as possible think about what a user will want to do after each of those steps  can you provide for that i think the signup and interest filling out is pretty straight forward maybe for the purpose of mocked functionality you want to just let users pick interests from a list that is built from interests associated with the orgs using the app then from that pull together a list of potential matches to put the user through make sure the matching page feels a little more comfortable with what exactly users are supposed to do after the matching make sure the user has somewhere to go to review their new findings with what awesome orgs they should get involved with this doesnt have to exactly be the outline of how you should plan things from here but its an example of how i might think about the key parts of each step  at each step does the user know what to do and what the next step should be after completion if this all sounds way too vague feel free to contact me whenever,23,281
1129,development plan good work really liking the detail on each of the task items would be useful to detail some tasks you will be using for your consistency check in week 7 i think its a great idea to have a list of basic tasks just like the one in this assignment to try to run through your app to gain an overall feel working out as many kinks before we dive into testing as you can would be awesome,0,80
1120,deducted single point for not meeting the following criteria,0,9
1121,every page is fleshed out and has their primary functionality implemented,5,11
1122,use of json data and handlebars fully support core app functionality,4,11
1123,task items are comprehensively detailed and clearly actionable,0,8
1125, no 2 sentence task description,0,5
1126,interaction flow good progress navigation is definitely improved i think the one area of confusion still with navigating is that the two main viewing tabs would likely be my questions and all questions i would suggest having that on the bottom bar along with your home button it doesnt make much sense to have to click into the menu and then to all questions to view all questions additionally i think in general it may be a better idea to show all questions as the default and have be my questions to be where you can tab to as a secondary track your stuff function that way when users first enter the app regardless of what they sign on to do they are immediately exposed to questions that they can possibly answer  you want people to answer stuff,0,138
1127,interaction flow everything is connected up pretty well but i think flow can still be improved for navigation in general you can consider some other options tabsmenu etc to restructure how a user moves through all the main pages although i wouldnt prioritize this because what you have works out alright with the home page having buttons to path deeper  the place where someone might feel the most lost is when they get to match me up there still isnt much indication of how long a user is supposed to stay in the matching phase and what they ought to be doing  should i keep matching until theres no more until i find one i like until i find 3 i like what should i do after the match me up phase etc,0,133
524,comments for the pov you—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎre telling me that sleep schedules contribute to healthy lifestyles you can reframe this by saying —ç’Îç’‘’ù’‘Îèpeople need a to maintain their sleep schedules—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎù even better would be if instead of talking about people you had a specific target usergroup in mind also you—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎre already bringing in the specific solution scaring your users that you will use to address your need that is what the storyboard is for not the point of view solid inspirations,0,79
525,deductions  pov specifies a clear need but doesn—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎt tell me how it relates back to the studio brief just needed one more sentence linking it back,0,26
526,inspirations were all directly related to cooking didnt go beyond that context to make more abstract connections,0,17
527, paper prototype 1 unclear navigational flow,0,6
520,prototypes dont contain enough detail how do i navigate the fridge prototype can i click on items inside of the fridge no update goal screen from prototype view,1,28
521,comments great inspiration board your point of view talks about health related goals but isnt specific to something a user needs to be able to do also it already includes a solution which it shouldnt do try thinking back to personas see scotts videos from week 2 and developing one or two example users for your app,0,57
522,deductions  user need is prescriptive not usercentered,0,7
523,inspirations showed apps that currently seem to solve the problem without explaining why they fall short if the problem is already solved by someone else why do we need your app,0,31
1014,competitive analysis good distinction from yelp but im not sure they are the best fit for covering similar solutions in the same market your app is based on utilizing media to explore where other people have explored for yelp thats a very secondary at best function can you find any other apps that focus on the idea of friend checkins,0,60
1015,interaction flow find explorers page primary functionality not quite clear and usable at the moment,0,15
1016,data its a start for data usage but as of turnin pretty sparse usage could you have better mocked up the find explorers page with some json data,0,28
1017,dev plan the creep block items probably could have been budged better toward finishing the primary functionality of all pages namely find explorers,0,23
528,comments well done on 2nd storyboard 1st prototype—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎs navigational flow was unclear like the idea for the second prototype is there a way to invite friends through the app via sms email etc seems like a crucial feature being able to find an event by name or organizer or something other than location seems like another important option to include,0,60
529,deductions  pov doesnt articulate a clear user need without also including a proposed solution,0,14
1013,supporting info haha nice self destructing task message,0,8
1234,functionality is great so far really like the concept and animations only thing is data doesnt seem to be handled asynchrounously through get or post,0,25
1235,i cannot tell if the multiplayer is actually working yet i think it would be essential to see that actually functional before we can test the interaction and how testers feel about hte app,0,34
1236,good job fill in more of the data so that the testers can see more examples of what the site might look like,0,23
1237,deductions for   prototype is completely functional there is nothing on the settings page but i do have a user account logging out im not able to log back in with the same username and password,0,35
1230,form validation user goes haywire,0,5
1231, account stuff  i know youre already working on it,0,9
1232,how does one actually join a particular event when i see all the interaction available on the app im assuming i can both create and join events how will i separate those two,0,33
1233,the functionality of submitting a photo is still not fully functional but the idea of submitting and liking others photos is neat very cute visual design the one thing was a bother was that every time i visited the home page the tutorial pop up would show up which can be redundant and annoying for users who have already gone through the tutorial data doesnt seem to be handled through get or post to be asynchronous it also isnt super clear from the home page that the main functionality is to submit pictures,1,93
1238,suggestions  i would make the tab that says goal  wishlist just say wishlist bc thats really what its about managing,0,20
1239, wishlist items have images but theyre not visible and i cant set them anywhere,0,14
439,great work bringing in inspirations not directly related to eating eg spotify,1,12
437,this shopping list idea is taboo i will need to see it become more divergent and unique how can personal informatics really enhance the utility of the app where are you using personal informatics in your prototypes and storyboards,0,39
434,the point of view could be more explicit but its still good its just that the point of view is strongly implied the motivational posters are a little too disconnect and obvious the prototypes are detailed but you would benefit from simplifying even further if you can as for the relation to the brief it does fit with it but could you look for a more nuanced relationship or deeper meaning between mood and productivity,0,75
435,since most people are indecisive  this claim lacks evidence,0,9
432,very well done very clear and easy to follow your thought process i had some difficulty differentiating your prototypes and also wanted to see how you thought current tools for this problem fall short but i think youre on the right track and with a solid pov you have plenty of material to guide your iterations,0,56
433,it is not clear how your pov engages with the studio brief or where current solutions fall short why does searching tip websites not work and how will your app help address that issue also  a little more detail on how your prototype flows would be helpful,0,47
430,look for deeper and more abstract connections for the pov make sure you decide on the specific audiencecommunity that follows your pov,0,22
431,careful getting too specific on a solution in your pov also as i said in class your storyboards should have a clear situation with a user need and a story of satisfying it  i like your pov and inspirations but think a little more critically about the issues of selftracking productivity,0,51
238,but your photos 1 and 2 were of solutions not of the observation breakdown or design opportunities,0,17
239,great diverse set of observations for this activity would have also been interesting to see how the rest of the exchange process goes rather than the beginning but i understand the constraints of time be careful about restricting insight to much to specific systems like tritontexty can we generalize things a bit more based on what you observed what general breaks down for online transactions and what needs can come based on that theres a lot of opportunities for different angles here,0,82
234,good job i like how you observed a diverse set of people who use emoji as well as create emoji,0,20
235,observations should provide more than a factual account of what you saw for example why does axell share any message that is not raw text  through facebook,0,27
236,some of your needs are much too feature oriented as opposed to a need that presents a design opportunity,0,19
237,the explanation of how each music affected the participants in your observations was great,0,14
230,i was confused as to what you were observing the observations did not demonstrate breakdowns that could serve as  design opportunities within the scope of this project some of the needs listed were focused on technologies rather than user needs remember that the studio brief is games with a purpose meaning you should be looking or behaviors or activities that could be improved through game design and game elements ie studying exercising socializing etc,0,74
232,no captions for photos,1,4
146,needs there are a few redundant needs that could be squashed into one,0,13
147,interesting problem space animal companionship definitely has many opportunities to be enhanced with technology transferring ownership temporary or permanent is definitely an often repeated process that is currently done manually and with varying amounts of success be interesting to see how design can help here,0,45
144,photo 1 the photograph does not really indicate the breakdownopportunity described in the caption,0,14
145,needs a few of these needs arent as relevant to the activity you observed,0,14
142,needs some redundancies,2,3
143,observations remember that you are trying to observe exchange in social situations some of your observation discussions dont seem to relate that much to that activity for example the breakdown with colin doesnt really show any slips with him exchanging during his social lunches only that he eats with the same friends a better breakdown for example might be that colin fails to talk about interesting topics because he eats with the same people every week,0,76
140,observations would like to see a lot more insightful commentary on the breakdownsdesign opportunities for each your observations it seemed like the main issue you brought up was that they had to use pictures of schedules to sync up in that activity where were the pitfalls what doesnt work about this method what does work,0,55
141,photo 1 similar to above its not clear where the breakdowndesign opportunity is in this photocaption having to default to using your phone to engage in the activity is not so much of a breakdown where exactly was the pitfall of this interaction,0,43
148,clever choice of social media medium to reach more diverse participants and also have some data automatically logged for you interesting stuff to think about when being connected to so many people how can we selectively exchange personal thoughts while still being efficient,0,43
149,needs some needs are redundant kyra connecting to peopleknownless known spontaneously to talk to vivian having a less distracting social media etc,0,22
939,he changes good work might be useful to condense all of these changes into a super concise list for ease of reference as you progress through development in the next few weeks,0,32
938,revisit missing discussion of concrete changes over time with design tools learned thus far i like the leveraging of already made networks to gain more catered reviewsindicators of where to go,0,31
933,plan would like to see a little bit more specificity in tasks focus on having things that are immediately actionable for example use he to make changes to hs adp and log is a pretty big task assigned to the entire group that requires a pretty big overhead in deciding who at what moment does what in particular   i would move the stretch goes into separate feature tasks so they are easier to keep track of and more modular in terms of who to assign to and what to do etc missing time estimates makes it hard to account for potential scheduling obstacles,0,103
932,he changes very thorough listing of he violations and changes to address them also nice organization with categorizing which changes youve already done and which are in progress not sure where make the login page the first page is occurring might have been an outdated change,0,46
930,revisit good discussion here about how you iterated from initial idea conception making the group experience fun and having a final judge can definitely be useful for facilitating exchange one thing youll definitely have to consider is the cost of employing this final judge especially if you are a wishy washy rascal that doesnt care to take part in deciding youll want to lower this cost as much as possible one way to go about this is to take advantage of repetition people with this problem may or may not up to you to find outdecide on this go out and eat often how can we leverage this especially if its samesimilar groups of people going out repeatedly can we give some extra valueincentive to those who use this over and over again which ideally is true if it is a fun and easy final judge,0,146
936,plan may be useful to add another column for page to organize grouped subtasks if you want to organize by page might be easier to visualize overall development structure that way,0,31
934,app good use of very obvious buttons and action colors blue for link to show what should be clickable and what is not in terms of mental models that part of what a user should expect is nice and straightforward interface wise the flow is not quite clear in how navigating through as a guest and as a user is supposed to differ currently it seems like just a hodgepodge of both mashed into the main screen key interaction flow that will want to be worked on next will be what happens after a user creates an event and on the flip what happens after a user joins an event how will that part of the exchange be handled to make sure the end goal for these users is met higherlevel comments below,0,133
829,individual he overall well organized and thorough would like to see some deeper insight on comparisons between the two prototypes beyond the two just having similar pitfalls,2,27
828,note try to have it in a pdf format next time rather than pages p,0,15
825,individual he overall great organization and analysis of usability good job on drawing comparisons between the two prototypes and presenting advantagesdisadvantages in both colorful,1,24
826,group he nice flow from highlevel overview to more specific usability issues would like to see more discussion on the conclusion reached about prototype 1 being too linear will the evaluated team understand where specifically that can make improvements if they are just told that it is too linear what potential solutions can you provide for this wherewhen does usability come in to conflict with whatever linear flow they had,2,70
820,severity ratings are a bit low in general for example id say tracking a users own post would receive a 4 i would say,1,24
822,would like to see some more deep feedback in comparisons between the two apps most comparisons were just that both performed well or poorly in the same thing,0,28
1482,online test results nice work qualitatively i definitely agree that the new sidebar design is better in terms of users not accidentally trying to click something that isnt clickable i also agree with the new icon for participants seems to work well,0,42
1481,overall looking pretty demoable looking forward to seeing any other updates made in the coming week,0,16
1480,fit  finish missing github link in assignment submission but thanks for the update piazza post,0,15
1487,eliminate the hamburger menu on your two screens that have it it can prevent people from going directly to the home screen which is well developed andit doesnt actually reduce the total number of button presses to navigate from one screen to the next still 2  its just cluttering up the top and isnt properly aligned on the setting page,0,60
1486,137 unique users amazing a few suggestions i know its late in the game and you may even be done making changes but,0,23
1485,good job with statistics page can you get more data without being too invasive,0,14
1484,i see youve snagged a domain name  nice looking forward to presentationdemo day,0,13
1489,chi squared calculation work needs to be shown,0,8
1488,,0,0
797,would have wanted to see more comparison between two prototypes otherwise i think your feedback was more insightful than most,0,20
796,half the summary paragraph talked more about the process and not the outcomes of the process,1,16
795,severity ratings a little extreme would have wanted to see more depth to feedback though its understood that its just paper prototypes,0,22
794,home page its a start not quite fitting into the mobile form factor which is currently the major issue one thing that i am noticing in the current page is that its not immediately obvious what differences in functions i as a user will have when i choose one of the three forking options find explorers and nearby seem to likely to do the same thing provided i give a location by dropping the pin as the current temporary background suggests its also not too clear what surprise me would mean on the flip you may not decided that this is as big of an issue if you expect users to figure out and learn quickly what these actions do could be useful to discuss as a team and decide on moving forward,3,133
793,group he good group evaluation was very useful especially in the context of this course to explicitly detail which heuristics your aggregately distilled violations fit into nice inclusion of very concrete example solutions for the evaluated team to consider i also do agree that because he has limited scope it is sometimes difficult to identify or even just consider identifying problems outside of the he domain as a follow up question what are some ways that we can set up an evaluation to have both the benefits of structure and the freedom of off the page thought,2,97
792,individual he overall good analysis of usability for both the prototypes  discussion of comparisons between the two prototypes was very sparse however another note is that some of the severity ratings dont seem quite fitting remember that these ratings are to help the evaluated team prioritize their fixes you listed severity 1 for a few issues that didnt appear to be purely cosmetic,0,63
791,home page great start some things to consider moving forward top banner can probably be shrunk down to save some real estate in the mobile form factor i notice a search icon in the top right but also a search bar in the body of the page are they for different uses if so how can we make sure the user is aware of both and their uses based on the goals of your app is there any other important information that a user might want to know in the preview feed of these food items other than name and price just some things to think about,3,107
790,group he good aggregate evaluation nice useful concrete examples of potential solutions to the major problems found interesting considerations of one user in the context of many others the discussion of how data on the app might be used after a session was particularly insightful,3,45
799,well done 1 pt deduction for lack of concrete and creative solutions to the issues found in the prototype,0,19
798,very comprehensive and i appreciated your comparison between the two prototypes however i had trouble seeing consistency in your severity ratings,0,21
1270,where are your handlebars files i only see html,0,9
1271,re as seen in lab 6 data are handled asynchronously using the get and post functions using ajax and getjson are also acceptable do not see the use of post functions or ajax equivalent,2,34
1272,comments  app is coming along nicely and it looks like work is being welldistributed great work,0,16
1139,data doesnt seem to be handled asynchronously no get or post functions in github repo good functionality so far,0,19
1138,plan items not detailed enough still really good job this week though,0,12
1133,competitive analysis good analysis but how did you know that users ditched habit apps like habitica was it in user reviews interviews make sure to provide evidence for reasons that people might be abandoning those apps,0,36
1131,dev plan nice definitely good to weed out things that are not worth implementing googlefacebook oath is for sure not a priority,0,22
1130,interaction flow server error on profile tab  the main primary functionality that is still missing is the how one should engage in the actual exchange between a teacherstudent we currently see a contact button but thats about it the messenger tab also isnt doing anything yet either up to your team on whether or not you want to integrate messaging if its an important part of connecting with the other party maybe its important but if its only secondary to what other system you might put in place for connecting two people you can put it on low priority and focus on other things,0,104
1137,github link need it for item 5,0,7
1136,would have like to see specific competitors listed also in a number of places you ask users to recall rather than recognize eg when putting in an assignment grade i have to recall what the overall weight is even when i entered the number previously when i created the assignment some styling issues as well but that does not matter at this point as we want you focusing on functionality and you have a good bit already,0,77
1135,thank you for the clearly readable dev plans you are a little short on the functionality analytics and navigation hitting the questions link took me to a dead page but i think you are headed in the right direction especially if you shift your focus quickly once you get the input down to how people can view and interpret the responses in a meaningful way,0,65
1134,app the village icon is the home button which i wouldve assumed is the homepage even though the mission log is the homepage further the log out button is typically pulled right on a nav bar to prevent users from accidentally clicking it while exploring the app the new mission button in mobile view is difficult to see and not very clear as to what it means these are some simple navigational elements that can impede user experience in your app when complete is clicked it does not direct to any page and instead leads to an error,3,98
1276, some major functionality is still missing 1 user acccount managementcustomization show only as many quarters as the user has attended ucsd for 2 i should be able to add classes to past quarters otherwise its not really much help to me i still n,0,44
1277, development plan looks well balanced but the commit log tells a different story didnt take a point off but will be checking in with your group,0,26
1009,dont have too many major comments on highlevel things maybe the largest scope consideration would be any power that the owner of the meeting has can they kick people can they restrict who can ask questionsmake polls etc might be useful to look into and its some set of features i might actually want if i were to use this app in a meeting  lecture etc the only other changes i have in mind right now is what we talked about in office hours about the navigation indicators kind of like breadcrumbs that tell you where exactly in the app you are for example on the page where it shows all the polls the top header can just say polls buttons can be bigger since it is for mobile,0,129
1008,great progress so far definitely on a good pace,0,9
1007,great competitive analysis didnt distribute work to kaitlin preassign the tasks more detail with tasks,0,15
1006,competitive analysis could be more convincing i hope you try to distinguish yourself more add more detail to dev plan ola and paulo need to start pulling more weight,0,29
1004,plan the main thing i would work on for your development plan is to have more specific tasks a good rule of thumb to go by is immediately actionable you want to avoid leaving tasks largely open ended like create x page theres a lot that can happen on a page one way to work around this is to group several smaller tasks under one page that way its all organized but the team and anyone reading the plan also has a good idea of what immediately actionable items need to be done tasks like you have toward the end of week 6 are better,1,105
1002,random thought  when searching for feedback on fashion will people ever want to have multiple photosangled grouped in a single post if that were the case would you want to allow for this but place a limit on how many could be interesting to consider,0,45
517,as you develop your personas and prototype further keep asking why why did you select the inspirations you did why are you interested in helping this particular user  why are you choosing particular features for your app right now a lot of the analysis remains at a surface level digging deeper by trying to understand the users motivations and your own goals in designing will help address that,0,68
1000,how would you like a user to proceed if they have a category in mind to browse into,0,18
623,thorough fairly concise and well ranked,0,6
622,needs an explicit and specific comparative analysis of the 2 prototypes as opposed to just listing the violations group evaluation for the 2nd prototype should include more actionable usability suggestions for improvement,1,32
1225, cant sign up always tells me password is mismatched,0,9
627,home page has too many things right nowno points deducted,2,10
625,severity ratings are a bit low,0,6
1229, should be less cost to creating an event  can we organize that form better,0,14
1228,created an event whoops want to get rid of it or edit it how can i do this,0,18
1535, yes and no should probably be responses to some question are you actually prompting people a question maybe better matched with i like this club and pass etc,0,28
2,good idea does it exist already,0,6
1286,development plan looks like you accidentally linked week 6 twice ping me on piazza with the link to the updated plan and ill revisit this edit got it,0,28
13,didnt see video questions on your online submission let me know if i should check your physical turnin,3,18
14,ensure you are completing entire assignment,0,6
19,prototype could be a little bit more telling and expanded as something a partner can interact with,0,17
18,the questions for the video dont need to be as long but should be on separate topics both your questions were about 1 particular example from the videos,0,28
1534,polishing opportunities  when making a profile how are you communicating what is required esp with the checkboxes,0,17
201,relevance a fair chunk of the observationsdiscussion appear much more centered around organization and multitasking rather than information exchange,0,19
200,warning please follow instructions and submit as a pdf not a doc,0,12
203,10  already mentioned to be able to be fixed via a true keyboard  being minor,0,15
202,needs some seem in the duplicate realm a few all about not getting distractedmultitasking etc,0,15
205,the user needs had a few too many feature descriptions that were also duplicates the crux of the issue seems to be to marry the physical interactivity a reader can have with a physical form with the advantageous features that a virtual form delivers,0,44
204,good observations i enjoyed how diverse the observed people were,0,10
207,however this was not demonstrated in the observations or their description specifically the description from the professor or the tas perspective was lacking if they were displaying apathy explicitly describe that also one observation that was specifically on the instructor would help,0,42
206,the idea that in an instructorstudent interaction stories and feelings are being shared is interesting,0,15
209,this topic is definitely interesting but the sketches submitted were sketches of features rather than of breakdowns or design opportunities observations were also not comprehensive and some of the needs were articulated as features,0,34
208,no photos given,0,3
1572, i took 1 point off of the poster because although you show the screens of your prototype,0,17
1571,thanks for a great quarter  glad to have seen your project grow from the very start,0,16
1570,very impressed with how much functionality and creativity you were able to implement into this app you all have done such a great job and i am so proud of seeing how much your app has grown thanks for a purrrrfect quarter ,0,42
1577,the point of view clearly conveys how the design is different from previous work,0,14
928,revisit explanation of relation to brief is there but discussion of concrete iterations through the design cycle is very very generic the first half of the paragraph could be applied to every project and not give too much insight into what specifically happened as the team worked through this first half of the quarter where did your ideas start how did they change what were some major influences etc,0,69
929,plan development plan tasks are too bighighlevel a good rule to go by would be tasks that are immediately actionable more specific is better for example two additional pages  theres a lot of overhead to be decided before you can actually act on this item which two pages what should be on them key links after navigation  what key links what is the skeleton work on changing this for future tasks in the development plan,1,75
920,like the direction your project is heading i considered the home page and tutorial page fully functional but the stats and profile pages still felt a bit like skeletons focus on functionality this week,0,34
921,appreciate your thinking on aligning with the brief had trouble viewing parts of the app so could not really test the navigation but as i recall from class much of the navigation was there though pages still needed to be fleshed out and the surveys were pretty minimal at this point think along the lines of how to motivate people to take the surveys what data they will get out of them not just what their employers will get and ways to do multifaceted data collection,1,86
922,i was a little unclear on what changes you planned to make and which you had made already also your assignment dashboard felt more like a skeleton than a fully fleshed out page however as discussed in studio i am more concerned that you think deeply about how to motivate and encourage students rather than just provide a central place for them to track grades focus on your user needs and dont get too sucked into coding a feature that does not directly address them though you should spend significant time developing this week,0,94
923,more detail in the revisit brief paragraph more functionality for the two screens good skeleton tho,0,16
924,prototype navigation is clean and mostly there so good job on that i also like that the functionality is simple and not too cluttered one thing is that it is still unclear what your pov is from looking at the app you want your app to stand out from other fitness apps myfitnesspal fitbit etc for example one thing lacking from fitbit is that when not wearing a fitbit or when not competing with friends users often arent as motivated to exercise because it isnt being monitored think about how you app can improve upon that intrinsic motivation problem,0,99
925,he changes do not see strong evidence that some of these changes were implemented in the app so far in fact change 11 is actually still pretty present  as a user it looks like i can click the schools on the front page but nothing happens technically you implemented change 13 but thats not quite an important change to address the evaluations at this moment would have liked to see things like 3 11 etc at least some simple interface changes that would have a large impact on usability,0,89
926,plan good detail on the plan  categorizing with the title column is very useful keep going for listing immediately actionable tasks love that notes include resources for where to start digging for information related to the tasks,0,37
927,app  the current navigational skeleton is confusing from the first page as mentioned earlier it is already odd that the user is unable to click through any of the colleges listed after drilling down into a college the app navigation completely chances as a header and footer are added header actions dont link to any skeleton pages footer works but again inconsistent with earlier stages of the application youll want to work on making this all consistent as soon as possible as well as making sure things that users expect to happen when clicking do happen as often as possible from studio also consider what kinds of persistent userspecific information will be important for both high school users and college users when i log on and have been using this app before to set up appointments what will i want to see to check up on those what will be most important to me to make all this exchange as smooth as possible,0,163
836,individual he missing comparisons drawn between both prototypes,1,8
837,group he this group feedback touches on some important points but seems disjoint from what is to be uncovered from usability evaluation your evaluator group places a lot of emphasis on particular highlevel feature changes and only a few brief mentions of what interface improvements could be made where does usability falter when a review system is missing it may be useful to have friends and strangers meshed into one app or it may not the work needed to discover those needs falls into other iterations of the design cycle is this something you can really draw a concrete conclusion on just by testing usability this is not to say it is a bad idea to suggest to the team you are evaluating to investigate that feature choice  its great that you included it the main issue is that such suggestions overpower discussion of the usability violations and their potential solutions,2,151
1532,fit and finish a couple bugs still surfacing,0,8
786,individual he missing comparisons between prototypes as far as severity ratings go it would probably be more useful for the team being evaluated if each listed violation had a separate severity rating looks like in your he priority was grouped generally under a heuristic even under the same heuristic some issues may have higherlower priority than others,0,57
780,group he this team evaluation is hitting aggregate violations but is not providing,2,13
781,any potential solutions to the noted usability issues what fixes were discussed in your evaluator team in line with the aggregate hes,2,22
783,individual he overall well organized and thorough he  main improvements to this he would be in priority ratings you noted quite a few violations as severity level 1 but they dont seem to just be cosmetic fixes additionally would probably group  meaning to ask a question under recognition over recall,0,50
1726,it would have been nice to visit some other inspirations that you might not have included in your first submission though you advertised the app on list serves it might have been more effective to post to facebook twitter etc as such there is not much evidence that your app was noticed through social media outlets,0,56
1727,good work i like how you simplified and solved the visual story of the 4 people coming together at the end,0,21
1724,awesome reach of geographically diverse audiences,0,6
1725,great job with the video too love it,0,8
788,home page good start some things to consider perhaps the navigation you have at the top of your app should be a little more condensed to not take up so much space in a mobile form factor common classic approaches would be a hamburger menu or maybe just having those be tabs at the topbottom like with how facebook mobile operates similarly will it be that important to have a giant banner with the name and most recent favr requests taking up 14th or so of the screen at all times perhaps we want to save more space for the feed itself remember that space is a lot more valuable and limited when working with mobile something else to watch out for is recognition over recall  think about what symbols terminology layout design etc can replace or upgrade less telling arrows,2,141
789,individual he excellent organization and analysis of usability the inclusion of potential solutions in that feedback is very useful for the evaluated team it was a nice touch to clarify evaluations from the standpoints of the two main user groups the boss and the regular users as far as the extra goes yes that could definitely fall under recognition over recall and is great insight offloading the cost of specific memory into generic space is a great observation and can positively affect the users experience,0,85
1720,awesome job on the video i did enjoy it,0,9
60,i liked your prototype,0,4
61,brainstorming should focus more on generating more diverse concepts two might not be be spread wide enough to search for those global maxima,0,23
62,nice work  ensure you complete the entire assignment  no feedback or video questions,3,13
63,missing the ideas sketch prototype and testing,0,7
64,good work  would like to see a wider range of ideas during ideation,0,13
65,brainstorming youll want to focus on generating a more diverse set of concepts the two you had were pretty limited by their similarity,0,23
66,prototype this should be separate from the details something that a user testing can interact with and not be preinformed by complete descriptionsexplanations,0,23
67,could have dug deeper in the interviews for some better insights,0,11
1371,looking forward to learning about how your ab goes ,0,9
1588,prototype offers a unique solution to improve a user experience or problem,3,12
1589,great work today it was awesome seeing the improvement of your app throughout the quarter everything went smoothly and the end product of the prototypepitchwalkthroughposter were all pretty good,0,29
1370,the redesign stems from the user testing and well reflects an underlying design breakdown or opportunity solution ab testing with it will produce informative results  not clear how user testing inspired this manipulation,0,33
1373,specifically awesome protocol  very detailed  well formulated,0,7
1038,much of the functionality hasnt been implemented the navigation is also still clunky as i am not exactly sure what i can do with the app and the skeleton task should be focused on the functionality rather than having user simply sign in and explore,0,45
1039,app while the idea is creative there is still much to be done about the functionality it is unclear what to do upon logging in and doesnt really yet feel like a game a good way to introduce someone to a game app is to have them learn while playing through it its unclear what exactly the game does as well the symbols are still somewhat confusing the navigation within the pages is still clunky and doesnt provide any indication as to what those pages actually are,2,87
508,inspirations were good but presented without specifics if all of these apps are so good where is the opportunity for your own product,0,23
509,comments your point of view needs some more thought what does someone need in order to achieve a goal it all depends on what the goal is try to get more specific by thinking back to personas see scotts videos from week 2 and developing one or two example users for your app once youve done that try to refine your idea to figure out what functionality your app is providing that they cant get elsewhere,0,76
1032,comp analysis follow up if you could come up with a single sentence tagline for your application what would it be fun to brainstorm as a group,0,27
507,deductions   user needs is extremely broad,0,6
1030,task the task given is not very concrete should be very specific as to what user should do,0,18
505,pov getting close but would still like to see a more articulated user need distilled into the pov in your design space what is it that users need to successfully try new places it seems like things were getting warmer with the description of how reviews typically are exchanged and interpreted by people what can this tell us about what core thing people need in your point of view,0,69
502,inspiration good discussion and organization,0,5
503,the pov is vague what tasks do people not want to do why do people lose motivation i would like to see more game elements incorporated into the app what do points mean how do they reward the user,0,39
500,great diversity in prototype designs while still working in the same design space,0,13
501,pov not clearly articulating core user needs your pov is a lot more focused on what the solution has to offer you need to make sure it also touches on the needs what do people need for say their social animal nature are we concerned about spontaneous unscheduled social concerns long term social bonding theres a lot of general space floating around that can be narrowed down more for a design project,0,72
1212,those prepare for testing tasks would have probably been better set as stretch goals,0,14
1213,notes  i would expect when clicking on a navigation tab to go back to the root of that tab name for example when im on the fresh blt burger page i would expect to go back to the general sale listings page when i click the for sale tab,0,49
632,the aggregate evaluation was also written very well which was rare,2,11
1216,good progress,0,2
1217,there seems to be quite a bit of functionality missing eg when users clicks red x nothing happens  when user clicks green arrow it automatically jumps to dropped  wouldnt the next step be to notify the user of a match and then directions for where to drop and then allow the user to notify the system theyve dropped the food,0,60
636,severity ratings a little off,0,5
637,would have wanted to see more comparison some errors mislabeled,0,10
638,comparison missing,0,2
639,good work  just a few issues    inappropriate feedback ratings for example feelings pageisconfusingbecause i didnt know which button could be pressed and which cannot had to randomly press everything on the page to see which ones are useful also pretty confused about how this page should be used2  if youre uncertain how to use a page that is a level 4 usability violation at least,0,65
1218,cancel this event doesnt seem to cancel,0,7
465,your point of view needs to be more specific what specific difficulties did they have why do they not have the chance to partake,0,24
1728,the thumbs up part might have been too longunnecessary,0,9
1729,nice video  prime acting,0,4
1106,you still have some core functionality missing analytics would also have liked to have seen uncompleted goals from w6 carried over to w7 you week 7 list is a little sparse but including the uncompleted goals from last week should leave you with plenty to do,0,46
1107,its coming along  nice work ,0,5
1105,looks like you are on the right track make sure to submit your prior weeks development plan in the pdf next week so i can compare also be careful about making actionable tasks on your dev plan some of your tasks this week are borderline ambiguous,0,46
1102,you might actually benefit from breaking down action items further think about the steps that go into implement adding good deeds to database clicking on the graphs disrupts the flow of the navigationfunctionality,0,33
1103,looks good just needs more work,1,6
1100,coding tip move all styling to its own css page its messy redundant and bad practice to place the css within the html pages,0,24
1101,great competitive analysis great work with functionality im happy to see an improvement,0,13
1458,well done on the test plan a few comments   the graphs still dont make sense i really recommend not putting in dummy data the average of the two moods also doesnt make too much sense,0,35
1459,i also really recommend changing the numbering cues to include if not emojis single word descriptions corresponding to meaning,0,19
1109,interesting how you havent included instagram in your competitive analysis,0,10
1722,video could have made the user need or the scenario clearer,0,11
1723,great job with these ec assignments the video was too long at more than 2 minutes but it got the point across about the app,0,25
216,observations some discussion seemed too focused on particular application interfaces from certain vendors while these can be opportunities for some interface design projects the variability in this can make it hard to find relevant needs for the activity you are observing,0,41
217,photo 3  not clear where the breakdowndesign opportunity is here if its that the customer didnt have an eta what kind of slip did that cause for the delivery man,0,30
214,first photo didnt demonstrate a breakdown necessarily observations and needs need to be more clearly related to studio brief,0,19
215,i was confused as to how the interviews and observations related to a project idea the sketches were more solutions rather than breakdowns i was unclear as to exactly what activity you were observing or interviewing for,0,37
212,you did great,0,3
213,you are focusing on a systemdriven design remember we need the user to input the data manually,0,17
210,be careful not to focus on the solution too much the needs were very featurefocused when they should be focused on the users needs outside of technological solutions observations also need to be more clearly related to studio brief,0,39
211,topic is good but user needs were missing from the submission also 2nd sketch didnt demonstrate a breakdown and the 3rd observation was not very comprehensive,0,26
1530,good work on having data update on both instructor and student side i still think your ab testing should have focused on more of the core functionality of the app changing the profile picture is a peripheral and additional functionality but not one that is really necessary for your app focusing more on the quiz play or creating a quiz aspect would have made for a more useful ab test dev plan should also specifically state which changes you will make in this upcoming week distribution of tasks has improved,0,90
218,some needs are too vague or not insightful,0,8
219,no clear activity picked more of an amalgam of various things while it was still valuable to go into these different activities not knowing exactly what you would find you want to narrow down your activity in this stage of the design cycle to gain as much insight about a particular activity as you can,0,55
919,glad to see you addressing the he feedback and thinking critically about how long people will use your app took me a while to figure out how to view my usage,0,31
918,not enough screens implemented this week nav skeleton leads to dead ends too often revisit brief paragraph is mostly good but does not trace the projects trajectory or reflect on the projects progress in any way,0,36
915,nav skeleton incomplete there should be links to all possible screens that a user might see even if the links lead to placeholder screens,0,24
914,the assignment required a detailed dev plan for three weeks weeks 57 only weeks 5 and 6 were planned please also be more specific in task names or you will lose points in the future ie  which pages are included in setup skeleton pages,0,44
917,great job with dev planplease use text wrap on cells where text is cut off so i can read it make sure each member is doing a fair amount of work for dev plans in the future please include foreseen and unforeseen obstacles which can be anything from having too many midterms one week which slows someones progress to being out of town,0,63
916,out of box point received for insightful and creative redesign of prototype and for implementing dramatic changes based on he and  further user interviews,0,24
911,would be nice to see the priority rankings listed in your he rankings present in your app otherwise well done,0,20
847,home page great start small feedback on just the current page so far we can utilize more screen real estate by just having the feed take up all the space rather than a bounded div moving the ask and answer buttons to the top or somewhere always reachable bottom tabs floating icons like in material design etc lots of options can allow you to fill the rest of the screen without losing visibility those key actions just something to consider,2,80
845,individual he good evaluation overall well organized and includes comparisons between the two prototypes as a note accidentally creating a meeting room or entering the wrong room isnt necessarily a error that you could detect as it would be on the side of the user to know whether or not that action was intentional having the ability to escape this accidental action would be more about giving users control to exit the recover from errors part of that heuristic probably led to this fuzziness but try to think about it in terms of recovering from an error that a system can actually recognizediagnose,5,103
843,group he good analysis of relation between usability artifacts overall goals of the app and experiences of users it is true that he is hard to hit a lot points when a prototype is primitive the level of feedback can be largely dependent on how thoroughly a prototype is fleshed out as a follow up question what kinds of things an we focus on to make he most optimally valuable when a prototype is very primitive,2,76
842,individual he extremely thorough and insightful usability evaluation well done you went very in depth with each violation and provided very useful feedback in the comparative portions of the evaluation great points like with the map being a strong example of recognition,0,42
841,good work but could have put more into it,0,9
1739,no need to show loggin in theres no need to show a screen and aimlessly scroll up and downor if there is an aim make it clear to the viewer the gameplay section does not need to be that long to make your point,0,44
1730,great job on the ec assignments,1,6
1732,great revisiting inspiration assignment while you posted the app to social media sites no evidence shown about its reach to the public or whether people actually used it would be useful to include how many people likedretweeted1 the post or a google analytics page about the apps usage nice work,0,50
662,severity ratings i feel need to be a bit higher for example the familiar metaphors and language feedback is something i would strongly recommend the group to think more on,0,30
1734,it would have been great to include some of these competitive analysis in your poster as well,0,17
1736,awesome job,0,2
753,individual he very well organized and great analysis of usability great out of the box use of pictures to make it easier for the evaluated team to consume the he useful comparisons between the two prototypes fantastic overall great job,0,40
750,individual he  noticed some verbatim duplicate bullets between the other evaluators be careful not to fall into too much emphasis on highlevel feature improvements rather than usability improvements i also noticed that you grouped a need for a reviewrating system under two heuristics would also like to see some deeper comparisons between the apps instead of just that both have the same issue good observation of how the name of application can affect how users perceive and use it though  very insightful,0,82
757,group he overall well done aggregate evaluation of the prototypes i like that you utilized comparisons between the two apps to suggest improvements  any kind of concrete examples are always useful for the evaluated to work toward improvements good inclusion of questions to prompt design decision discussions within the evaluated team,2,51
756,individual he pretty well organized and good analysis some violations are a little strangely categorized like your help bullet not being able to set profile information isnt quite under help and documentation missing comparisons between the two prototypes,0,38
1595,walkthrough goes up to 2 min only need a high level description and dont have to walk through the full scoring system,0,22
506,the idea of offering options between friends friends of friends  friends of friends of friends i think is very clever this design can have many implications that can have strong effects on the overall exchange experience i would love to see how that potential design could play out as you iterate toward a final solution,0,55
1597,posters application flow could have flown better no competitive analysis provided for poster,0,13
1596,should introduce the walkthrough with what the apps goal is,0,10
1591,great job today awesome seeing the app progress throughout the quarter,0,11
1590,thanks for an amazing quarter ,8,5
1033,interaction flow flows love the change with the navigation from burger to tabs definitely works well with the amount of paths available to the user the one bit of flow left thats still a little fuzzy that i know your team is already working on is that from picking deliverypickup to payments and so on a lot of that was already mentioned in studio,0,64
1599,the slide doesnt really demonstrate what the application does or looks like,0,12
504,first storyboard was too difficult to read and follow in the first prototype how does this differ from already existing quizzing apps  why does dressing the character matter or how will it incentivize users in the 2nd prototype what does an adventure consist of i liked that the 2nd app included scheduled breaks,0,53
1025,github url didnt work couldnt give points for json data without this info task for testing wasnt very detailed or concrete a better task would be to ask user to complete a chore and verify it,0,36
1024,app i liked the flipping card portion great functionality the tutorial page doesnt lead anywhere you should have it lead to some placeholder page at least good functionality and navigation otherwise the symbol for your house settings makes it seem like this would be the home page even though it isnt you may want to change that to have a more generic settings symbol i think you might also want to emphasize the housesplitting aspect of this app and really emphasize the trading card system of it as this is the major differentiation between your app and others that may be similar,1,102
1027,task 2sentence task isnt really a concrete task for users to do instead it describes what the app can do,0,20
1021,competitive analysis your analysis doesnt specifically mention any of your competitors you should include specific apps that are similar to yours and compare them explicitly to show why yours is different or better,0,33
1020,app submit button on home page is missing though the functionality is there one thing that hasnt yet been fleshed out is what happens when the user starts cooking how can the user unlock more tastebuddies    instead of having the chef icon on your recipes maybe just allow the user to see the recipe by simply clicking on the image this would seem to be more intuitive the bookmarked pages tab doesnt lead anywhere should at least lead to a placeholder page,1,82
1023,competitive analysis 2 of the 3 apps you mentioned were geared to children you should touch upon more apps that are geared towards your target demographic like the chore wars app i linked to you in piazza,0,37
1022,app there is a lot of text on each of the pages and a lot of scrolling you may want to think of ways to either shorten the text or make it easier to navigate through the text having the learn more and lets get started buttons in two different places are a bit redundant and confusing a better way to link these two would be to have a single button to get started and a link to the learn more underneath it it is also unclear what the levels are when level 1 stiffy appears on the page i was unaware of what this meant,6,106
1036,the task items must be clearly actionable the week 7 tasks are too vague,0,14
1029,app i think the game elements still need to be better fleshed out and the pov is still not very clear good visual design and simple navigation,0,27
1028,competitive analysis could go more indepth into how the interactions of your app make yours better than the existing apps the current competitive analysis doesnt really  dive into how your features differ from other apps,0,35
1037,a few too many tasks are in progress or incomplete this week adjust your next weeks plan accordingly,1,18
1034,dev plan nice progress,0,4
1035,the pages dont have their main functionality implemented,0,8
604,i had too much fun pressing the menu toggle in your home page ,2,13
606,little off with the ratings could have gone deeper with the feedback and the comparisons,0,15
600,individual he solid analysis of usability interesting discussion on dynamic updating and how that might effect the experience of someone using the app dynamic updating is a pretty cool problem and will definitely be something fun for the evaluated team to play around with for example even when there is dynamic updating say on facebook people still swipe down all the time to refresh  fascinating behavior would like to see some more in depth comparisons between the two prototypes most of what was mentioned was simply that both prototypes fell into a similar issue,0,94
1205,page renders way too small on mobile mode,0,8
1204,recipe leads to nowhere bugs like that should get fixed before user testing,0,13
1207,oh whoa a lot of text there is editable profile page,0,11
1206,some goals were unmet,0,4
609,home screen link didnt work but because it worked on your teammates submission no points taken off should include a specific and explicit comparative analysis between the 2 prototypes,0,29
1203,there are quite a lot of scrolling involved which isnt appropriate for a mobile form factor,0,16
1202,posting reviews doesnt seem to be working also the posting page needs to be simplified,0,15
1211,dev plan  rip parse,0,4
634,ensure youre completing the assignments eg comparisons across prototypes also a login page is not a home page,0,18
635,nice job summary could have explored more solutions and speak more to the he and less about the product,0,19
1214,can gray out the disabled button even more for better contrast,0,11
1111,github repo needed this to verify use of json etc,0,10
1117,main functionality lacking in many pages makes the interaction hard to evaluate as is make sure you guys get it ready for testing this week,0,25
464,storyboards lack sufficient detail  the prototypes need to diverge more  the ideas are too similar,0,15
1119,your github url seems to be broken httpsgithubcomwscottmillercookingmamarealedition gave me a 404,0,12
1118,missed some goals this week avoid having all assigned to a task make sure to have a single owner,0,19
467,inspirations lack competitive analysis  only compares to one event venue facebook,0,11
1448,good job overall as a note on metrics for testing timing may be a hard one for distilling insights another potential metric o maybe think about is whether or not one design is more conducive of using the category options as you noted in your tests some users just wanted to jump straight to search essentially a question of exploration vs premeditated want  would different designs influence how much users explore rather than directed search could be an interesting question not required at all just leaving it out there for thoughts,0,91
466,your inspiration picks shouldnt explain only what that the app does but how it inspires you,2,16
1357,comments there are clearly still some pieces of information missing but overall your plan seems straightforward and well laid out,0,20
1355,wanted to see a little more detailed protocol i should be able to replicate your study just by reading it  focus on wrapping up functionality and styling this week are the activity and rankings pages going to have any data that reflects what users do eg what buildings they walk around or is that just canned data,0,57
489,prototypes 2 not clear how the flow of the application works when looking at the prototype there are two options on the first page list and random when clicking list you are taken to the random screen for rouletting popular foods is a list then created from choosing from the random wheel what then is the purpose of the dice rolling icon on the first screen not clear how all of these elements connect and how the flow should be directed,1,81
487,i think the 2nd prototype was much more interesting than the first i liked the idea of a fitness rpg in a sense it reminds me a bit of habitica and run zombies inspirations should have included some games that you drew inspiration from,0,44
486,very well done 2nd storyboard could have been more detailed in setting the stage and addressing how the app contributes to solving the problem,0,24
485,the pov should go more into why people dont follow personal hygiene tasks consistently you may also want to broaden the scope of your app teethbrushing is too narrow i also had a difficult time following the sequencing of prototype 2 great and creative topic and idea,0,47
1354,the quiz aspect still doesnt seem very gamelike is there a point system or what rewards does the user get for completing quizzes and questions correctly ab test plan should include hypotheses and potential interpretations of results,0,37
483,prototypes are borderline too flushed out  just use single colored thick pen to constrain level of detail possible,0,18
482,inspirations lacking metaphorical comparisons   competitive analysis  why do some of these platforms fall short of addressing the user need,0,19
480,while prototypes are strong storyboards lack sufficient detail,0,8
199,some needs not relevant to brief could be more insightful,0,10
198,good work  seems as if there are interesting design opportunities about scheduling especially our reluctance to commit eg maybe syndrome looking forward to learning more about this in future assignments,0,30
195,photo 1 doesnt really cover the breakdowndesign opportunities you observed with this participant,0,13
194,as we discussed in class you should not ask people to describe how they think someone in new york does something instead you want your interviewee to reflect on what they are an expert of eg their own experiences while its great that youre reaching out to tas to get feedback ensure you are then implementing that feedback in your work,0,61
197,not enough user needs user needs are too similar and rephrased for different users,0,14
196,overall i think it was great that you covered multiple avenues through which people decide to make book purchases most people will simply jump on the conclusion that there should be a catchall app that everyone can use and viola textbook exchange solved however as you have observed it is important to consider design opportunities everywhere in bookstores social media online marketplaces etc,0,63
191,a need such as students need to have an easy usage application not too complicated to learn is too generic to offer any design opportunities,0,25
190,the observations are only factual accounts and doesnt demonstrate any empathetic reflection on how the usage of instagram affected the participants also make the breakdowns explicit,0,26
193,great job focusing on user needs the 1st photo didnt demonstrate much of a breakdown may have been better to show what was on his screen to show that he doesnt use reminders or calendars,0,35
192,there were no explicit description on what breakdowns you saw in the observations to relate to the brief reflect on what kind of emotions the stories each participant found made them feel,0,32
1454,suggestion show results from the current day by default,0,9
1455,looking good i really enjoyed the link to the course website in the help menu ,0,15
1456,two suggestions 1 for the completed goals view the whitespace can be reduced because users dont need to interact w individual lines you might even consider keeping the 3 categories collapsed and having an easy way to see how many of each type of goal has been collapsed maybe by titling the buttons easy 12 or whatever else you think of,0,61
1457,2 i would go for a friendlier font in your onboarding screens and also use different weights and sizes for emphasis the text itself is good but especially if your app is focused on shy individuals you want to be as inviting as possible,0,44
1450,deductions  redesign is not fully functional i couldnt see the goals that i added after adding them on the goals page,0,21
1451,  point off for discussion of outcomes although you are measuring a quantifiable user behavior your measurement is not wellsuited for the type of experiment youre trying to run because on mobile in order to view the tool tip text the user will alre,0,43
1452,comments  there is no tool tip in a mobile web app your assignment for the course project is to design for the mobile context if you plan to display the text when the button is tapped then you should explain that,0,41
1453,bug after adding a goal the goals page continues to show the message you dont any unfinished goal yet i considered taking a point off for this given that it is a pretty obvious bug but it might be possible that neither of your users came across th,0,48
902,think your project is headed in the right direction as we discussed in class id like to see it align a little more closely with the brief understand you plan to add analytics but was hoping to see that idea fleshed out a little more this week,0,47
903,he changes nice organization and prioritization of violations for changes very handy to separate changes done and changes todo for the filtersearch i think it can still be deconfused a little bit more with a field for text and a dropdown for certain categories its not immediately clear how the flow is supposed to work there my current mental model things that they should be separate if thats true you might want to physically decouple the filter dropdown from the search i assume the dropdown is to reorder the information that is displayed and the search input is to drill down to more specific information on the same line it looks like they are supposed to be used in conjunction before hitting the search icon,3,125
900,remove forcing login skeleton doesnt flow,0,6
901,revisiting the brief has good writing no fluff writing but i want to see more changes to the app to better align with brief and the paragraph could have gone further in that sense,0,34
906,revisit nice discussion catering to both sides of the exchange will definitely be a plus and will require a good amount of work keep looking toward other applications that do things well  a year in the lab will save you an hour in the library,0,45
907,only one additional screenrecommended implemented,1,5
904,plan may want to work on breaking down what the shopping cart page should contain especially core interactions sometimes its also best to have tasks that have strong measurability in success look into sending a may be better phrased to find a resource that has a tutorial on how to etc so that you have something concrete to go off of outside constraints may also be handy placed under each respective week so they are visible when looking at that weeks plan otherwise keep it up with the specific tasks immediately actionable is a good rule of thumb,0,98

854,well done a few small issues severity ratings were not has harsh as they could have been and you interspersed positive feedback with your general heuristic violations this is useful feedback but should have been included in your feedback paragraph the potential solutions to usability issues were overall good but a bit obvious,0,53
855,comparisons between the two apps were minimal but otherwise well done really liked the paragraph that your group came up with for this assignment as it was concise and to the point well done,0,34
856,overall  the severity ratings were off another evaluator mentioned that there was no way to see if the alarm was set or not thats a huge part of the functionality not mentioned as a violation here and not mentioned by any of your group members in the final paragraph,0,49
857,some of the specific violations that had issues it seems like there are multiple title screens which is redundant 1 i would say this is at least a 2,0,29
853,you lost 1 point  for not being more specific on the types of solutions to the usability errors that you proposed  otherwise well done overall,0,25
858,it can be hard to get the hang of critiquing others work you might have the tendency to assume that if something is confusing to you the fault is your own but this type of heuristic evaluation is specifically meant to put the person creating the prototype on notice about any and everything that might be wrong with their design,2,60

1057,comp analysis nice analysis are you actually planning to group by location would be pretty cool but also adds a whole other level of complexity into things you would have to plan for,0,33

1472,forgot your github urlits ok because i already have it but pay more careful attention to the rubric,0,18
1473,online test results nice perspective toward the end very useful to think about the less techsavvy user im sure eventually at some point in time the assumptions we make about prior user knowledge may encompass things like the  but as of now what you all discovered makes a lot of sense as far as how people might be perceiving the simple icon,0,62
1470,not enough work shown for ttest the extent of work shown should be similar to if you did a ttest for math homework,0,23

1474,app is looking good and pretty demoable to me really awesome to even see the integration of swipe search is working too  very nice one note on search though im not sure it was immediately intuitive that the search bar appeared in the header when clicking the search tab i kind of expected the search bar to show up on the actual page below the header great job,0,68
1478,changes  notifications might be pretty consumingnot as useful at this scope esp wo real accounts yet so i wouldnt worry about that one,0,23

499,insp good analysis of different inspirations to draw from using a feed is a really interesting idea recency relevance of past experiences is something that can definitely change an entire design experience,0,32
494,great job with the prototypes and clever ways of representing certain interface interactions dont worry too much about spending time on certain elements of the prototype if they wouldnt be too important of a design decision at this stage for example the login screen with typing etc there may not be that much to gain from testing that interaction at this stage with a prototype unless you go for something more novel in how you log users in,0,78
495,in general it wasnt immediately obvious where the two prototyped solutions critically deviated in highlevel design it seemed like they were both in the area of an inventorymarket for renting out equipment knowing exactly what core design decisions make an appprototype what it is will be important for iteration more distinguishable prototypes is very useful for such iteration thinking about the discussions and feedback had in class may help with bringing out the focus on core areas of design for your solution,0,82
496,pov wouldshould is not a user need what have you distilled from what this user group needs and what is your design strategy to address that,0,26
497,inspiration good addition of the a mentormentee system learning from how that works and why it is successful can be very valuable for your proposed solution,0,26
491,be careful using the word should in your pov your inspirations should better address why those apps dont address your problem as well as your app would i would like to see more game elements in the prototypes particularly the 2nd one otherwise great job and very thorough prototypes,0,49
492,your pov should state more clearly the user need the storyboards were very well done while the prototypes were wellmade and wellsequenced i would like to see more game elements or more reason why your points systems and leveling up matters or how this might change users behavior,0,48

1559,updated,0,1
1464, potential revisions not listed on development plan wish that youd added a final push to include some additional functionality to the app eg some way to track existing requirements,0,29
869,i would focus down your application though 4 things are a lot of things to cover and implement your last point seemed the most interesting to me but thats just me discuss and think what best solves the user needs you found,0,42
861,i liked the way you structured your summary of the violations,0,11
860,very thorough especially on the comparisons between apps well done,0,10
863,comparative feedback did not discuss overall relative strengthsweaknesses of the prototypes only talked about how the two prototypes shared similar issues,0,21
862,points off for  less than 15 violations in total found,0,10
865,well done overall but you didnt have any explicit comparison of the two prototypes as far as your feedback goes i think your advice was solid but could have been rephrased at times if two buttons do the same thing make their text match  maybe better to say if two buttons on different screens do the same thing make their text match another suggestions you made was to provide help if a button is confusing i think thats good advice but incorporating it also means considering the tradeoffs present between giving lots of help and suggestions and maintaining minimalist design and enabling flexibilityefficiency of use for example every time i open  the github desktop app a mini tutorial teaching me how to use the app and git shows up i have never gone through the tutorial and usually close it but it still shows up every time i use the github app which is now not very often,0,158
864,not enough violations written comparison was well done but overall insufficient feedback,0,12

883,home screen is too simple to gleam any he changes also additional two screens are not fleshed out,0,18
882,your point of view and its relation to the brief isnt clear from your paragraph what are the human centered needs you are trying to satisfy how is what you describe different from already existing forums,0,36
881,navigation flow is not present for example theres no way to get back to home page from profile page or cancel the new post,0,24

884,development plan is currently too short for the scope of the project needs a lot more planning to cover the interaction with the planets,1,24
889,he changes really well done great detail on the violations and very handy organization with the list of changes where you distinguish changes done and changes to be made might look to get this to be a requirement for future a5s i really like this simple categorization,0,47

776,individual he missing severity ratings for fix prioritization,0,8
771,group he  overall good group discussion and feedback it was good that you included connection to the web development environment since that was part of your knowledge as he handling accounts and connecting them is most certainly a core part of the application that should be discussed by the team you evaluated definitely agree that he is very useful for aspects of the application that users interact with  usability is the main target of he,2,75
770,individual he well done overall organized with good comparisons drawn between the two prototypes an improvement would be to work more on the prioritization through severity ratings it seems like quite a few of the violations that were more than just cosmetic were given a rating of 1,0,48
773,individual he well organized and thorough discussion as mentioned in studio good insight on handling when dependencies cannot be reached or are broken always something important to consider in an application how can we not lose users when something goes wrong,0,41
779,individual he excellent analysis very well organized and thorough the way you phrased the violations in a perspective that really gives the story of someone experiencing the interface was great also really good work with categorizing which bits of feedback could be considered a missing feature,0,46
77,ideate more kinda fixated,0,4

1042,interaction flow flow is pretty good right now a lot easier to navigate through than in the past iteration main things missing here is just primary functionality implemented in all the pages remember it can be mocked up wizard of ozed but we still at least want some kind of functionality that can give users an idea of the interaction flow,0,61
1041,github link you have a lot of files within your repository that can be condensed that would make your git repo more organized and easier to navigate,0,27
1040,dev plan dev plan was incredibly blurry even when zoomed in because i couldnt read it i cant provide points for anything related to the dev plan aside from what i can infer from the color coding please paste in a more clear and readable image of your dev plan for future assignments or provide a link to your plan,0,60
1047,also include a preliminary plan for all future weeks,0,9
1044,dev plan a lot of things are still in progress make sure you have good communication with the team to get stuff done still quite a bit of functionality left to go so carefully work out the next weeks plan also a lot of these items are pretty fuzzy  not a lot of concrete actionable tasks for week 6 makes it harder to get them done have tasks such that the measure of completeness is implicit in the task that which gets measured gets done,0,85

1681,that pitch though audience reaction was great definitely memorable and had content to it too fantastic job,0,17
1683,great job today your  team was consistently ahead of schedule with functionality throughout the quarter and did a great job with polishing up the app,0,25
1685,thanks for an amazing quarter  you should try out the app in some real meetings if you havent already,0,19
1684,the slide is a bit heavy on the words and content the right hand side is distracts a lot from the key left hand side components and overall has too much information to consume,0,34
1687,out of the box point actually for incredibly well done functionality and implementation the amount of stuff your team fully completed is so awesome good work,0,26
1686,great job today would have liked to see more explicit discussion on the poster demonstrating what makes your application unique i think you had a lot of features that you could have talked about there and it would have been especially useful considering all the food apps,0,47

667,could have used clearer comparison of the two prototypes also expected your home screen once you logged in not the prelogin marketing materials,0,23
1262,user can take a photo but followthrough functionality eg doing something with that photo does not exist  this aspect seems important to address your users needs,0,26
665,you should identify the problem or violation before suggesting a solution also a clearer comparison on the prototypes would help the team see where one is stronger than the other,0,30
664,would liked to have seen a clearer comparison of the two prototypes rather than just listing the issues each has,0,20
1267,how will a user know what the event is that they are blocking off time for its very likely people will forget and without any notes they wont be able to remember,0,32

1468,online test results great job nice detail and organization with the whole process analysis and results are clear as well,0,20
1018,misc app stuff i think flow wise because of how simple the app is most of that is pretty in order its a lot of functionality work now especially since you have a decent amount of dependence on some third party applications make sure you can find a way to get that done and if its too complicated ensure that you have a backup plan for wizard of ozing it by the end of this week you want essentially a minimum viable product that can successfully let your user find their next adventure so you can get the best results out of testing surprise me is pretty straight forward so i would put a good amount of effort into getting at least one of find explorers or the map working so that a real flow exists ideally the map since it seems like the main feature,1,146
1461,nice work its mostly there,0,5
1463,excellent work,0,2
1019,great jobbe sure to update the dev plan to slowly include tasks for weeks 810 as well add your own stretch goals if any,0,24

1310, not you button is quite large but the use case for this is probably  1 of the time try making element prominence proportional to their frequency of use  i like the idea of having a custom message for the person who logs in if youre looking for s,0,48
1319,when creating an account it asks for my myers brigs type  how do i know this can you enable your users to quicklyeasily find this out eg take them to myers briggs site but then how do you encourageremind them to come back  finish creating their profile a short custom variation of the mb test embedded within your own app etc,0,61
1318,why is johnny the only one making commits the git repo,0,11
1011,interaction flow main navigational deadend issue right now is with your menu not being functionally implemented yet technically you can back enough times to get to another point but a user shouldnt have to do that  most blocking thing right now in terms of flow  other than that the other major consideration i would give to flow is with the renting out your gear path that we talked about in studio there can definitely be a more condensed while still guided if thats what you want to go for way to request input for renting out some gear,0,98
319,obersvations not quite clear where the breakdownsopportunites are for 3rd obs yudha does textcalling to book not work is it inefficient is yudha failing to accomdate because of some facet of this method,0,33

1337,im not sure how you plan on measuring the click heat map,0,12
1332,if an event is updated would the user receive a text with updated information didnt seem to do this for me but would be important to notify users,0,28
1521,online test results awesome job i think your conclusion about which design to pick based on error rates and satisfaction surveying even with inconclusive timing measurements is very reasonable very cool working around google analytics with your own system,0,39
964,make sure your development plan items have a single owner assigned this is important even for things youll be doing together as that person will be personally responsible and accountable for the job most of your items look good so no points deducted,0,43
965,for revisiting the brief your point of view is still very much solution based and the core human need is unclear explore the need you are satisfying more deeply what makes collaborative storytelling more fun and  surprising how does that bring out empathy from people,0,45
966,ensure to complete the assignment eg spell out exactly why this is related to the brief instead of simply assuming so,0,21
960,prototype i think you guys did a great job considering you are a now a group of 2 the navigation is clean and functional i liked the simplicity of understanding in your site suggestions try to think of how your app might stand out from other fitness apps think about why those apps are successful and where they might be lacking a minor suggestion would be to have a home page so separated from the home page so that when you click on wefit you go to a home screen rather than your profile also it was difficult to tell which were plans to be implemented from your hes and which were actually implemented,0,114
961,development plan wellthought out and organized one thing to think about is scaling your development plan to 2 people and how youre splitting up tasks ie by estimated time skillset pages etc also your paragraph revisiting the brief should mention how the design process you have learned up to this point have helped you in applying the studio brief,0,59
962,prototype the major navigation is present and has a nice simplistic design it is still unclear that the purpose of the app is to challenge friends to complete tasks it might also be useful to have some placeholder examples in your what do you have to do today section so the user is fully aware that this is where they need to type tasks because this is a challenge a friend kind of game you might want to make the task list seem more competitive than simply a task list,3,90
963,development plan wellthought out and organized development plan,0,8
968,heroku link is broken previewed the html via github but the all links were broken from login page therefore not able to assess any of the development work,0,28
969,for future assignments ensure sustainable functionality dont push faulty version to your live sight if editing,0,16
1560,i like the redesign much more sleek a few issues of polish such as missing images those should be easy to add  when the amount provided exceeds a daily percentage reqd then the bar disappears entirely try catching this case and maybe making the bar red i know there isnt much time before the demos friday  2 deductions work is not evenly distributed and there is some final polish lacking on the prototype,0,73
1241, 1 point off for uneven distribution of work,0,8
878,no link to plan,0,4
1240,the prototype has made a lot of improvement from where it was previously im confident you will be able to make the corrections needed for the final project,0,28
876,development plan really solid development plan only thing missing is the addition of outside constraints in the upcoming weeks ie midterms jobs other projects etc,0,25
874,1 point deduction because the two addtional screens implemented are basically identical in content otherwise solid effort on this step,0,20
875,more detail in plan include assignment details like writing,0,9
872,overall well done deductions for  number of he violations addressed was low and didnt reflect the total number of reviews you received,0,22
1243,need a way to delete accidentally added past meals,0,9
870,prototype good job so far with the navigational skeleton some of the changes that were stated as implemented did not seem to be implemented ie no login option from guest mode navigation was good but again you will want to have a back button or clear nav bar on all pages be sure to make your site responsive to mobile size make the aesthetics consistent throughout the site  minor suggestion for the locked questions you might want to put a small padlock symbol by it so its immediately obvious that the question is locked,0,94
871,development plan good breakdown of tasks but you need to include outside constraints ie midterms for upcoming weeks so all group members are aware of other commitments,0,27
1242,suggestions  need a way to edit pictures associated with meals,0,10
9,1 point off for prototype being so short overall good job,0,11
1245,awesome to see this come together ,0,6
1244, ui for suggestions page is a bit unclear it looks like im adding 2 hamburgers at once would like to see from that page why theyre being suggested  instead of youre doing good maybe  you could use some protein along w a suggestion of an egg,0,46
890,plan well organized good work with having specific subtasks under larger groupings  keep it up with the nice immediately actionable tasks  one thing to consider moving forward with the plan is how you will indicate those unfinished tasks from the previous week and how you will prioritize those nice separate schedules tab too,0,53
892,revisit good paragraph would have also been interesting to discussion some of the very early conceptions of the app idea to compare with where it is now,0,27
893,awesome for everyones an expert,0,5
894,prototype great consistency and simplicity in your design navigation was simple and mostly laid out overall great job,0,18
1247,clicking send to message chef  from foodinfo page  confirm and message chef also are not functional so user runs into roadblock,0,21
897,minor deductions for navigational flow being a bit unclear and the additional screens implemented being somewhat incomplete overall making good progrress,0,21
646,i liked the comparison to physical books in familiar languages and metaphor,0,12
1249,notes sign out page has very low contrast between foreground and background  buttons are overlayed,0,15
1537,a couple fixes to your app in this final week there should be some way to edit your friends list ie rename delete friends again there should be some confirmation as to how many points it takes to level up or whether checking in with multiple friends is better than 1 or none etc a stretch goal for some of the gamification elements you guys were mentioning could be to have challenges or quests ie check into a lunch place with a friend or check in with 2 or more friends this could also help with solidifying your pov,0,99
767,some of the heuristics for match between system and real world would better fall under familiar metaphors and language aggregate evaluation should have more potential solutions for violations,0,28
764,individual he great evaluation good work drawing comparisons between the prototypes i particularly liked the discussion of wording of create a favr simple phrase design like that can sometimes make all the difference,0,33
1079,nice work strengthening the dev plan ,0,6
1076,the navigation in general feels cumbersome the top 30  and bottom 30of the main page is unnecessary,0,17
1077,your week 7 tasks are missing,0,6
1074,i dont understand your comparison of the background picture with other content management systems like wordpress wordpress would have even more customization options than what you currently provide,0,28
1072,dev plan nice discussion of your dev plan changes your plan is definitely a lot more concrete and detailed now good work  hope the plan is helping with team dynamics communication and effectiveness,0,33
1073,looks like your development is on track submit a clearer image of your previous development plan next week i cant read yours for this week,0,25
1070,interaction flow functionality wise everything is pretty well connected and primary functionality is there now its time to fix things up for usability on the mobile form and to work on some of the clarity of use as noticed in the studio sometimes it wasnt exactly clear what was being viewed on the home page with the whole which favrs am i doing and which ones are other people doing i think its a good start to try to delineate that by only showing completed buttons for the favrs you are doing but we can probably do better even going back to the drawing board with wording of the two categories might help sounds weird but even something where favr isnt in the phrase can be clear too for me for others with a general favrs title above both my example might not be the best but hopefully it helps trigger some potential changes,2,154
1071,small git note might want to move your code to an actual separate repo your repository is still technically forked from lab4 so its kind of a hugely iterated lab4 having a new repository for your project is a bit more appropriate and maintainable for longevity,0,46
1561,the two tables for the powerupp button testing and workout select testing were the exact same but you had different chisquare calculations was this just a typo in the numbers entered into the tables,0,34
1674,you all have done such a great job with your app im so glad to have seen this project through from the beginning you did really well in your presentation thanks for a wonderful quarter ,0,35
1675,slide didnt feature the app interface and could have had less text but i was really impressed by the functionality of your app great visual design and im so glad to have seen this project through from the beginning thanks for a great quarter ,0,44
1676,great job today for the common problem space that your team picked i think you did a fantastic job and bringing a unique twist to it with the colocated tech assisted live participation and randomized rolling,0,36
1677,managed to pull through with a lot of functionality good stuff only thing i would have liked to see more in the poster would be a little more explicit discussion of unique value prop,0,34
1671,ps get well soon you all seemed to have that roll of tissues so often,0,15
1672,great job today super awesome to see the progress of favr fam over the quarter quite a difference between week 5 and week 10 of the app,0,27
1094,a lot of pages that dont have stuff if youre not going to implement them they shouldnt be included,0,19
1096,some of the pages are dead endsdo not exist  if you dont implement them remove them,0,16
1097,competitive analysis lacks depth and detail your app is very unique and it would have been very easy to explain how functionality differs from the general market however your description merely brushes over these unique features and does not make a competitive analysis,0,43
1090,competitive analysis good mention that there are not really games that tackle social anxiety or inhibition,0,16
1091,app i like the core functionality of checking in there still needs to be some confirmation of after you check in some features to think about implementing are different point values for checking in with friends vs checking in alone a way to change mood or assess mood when hanging out with friends a way to post pics while hanging out etc good simplistic design,0,65
1092,app great simple navigation there are some symbols in the shop section that are not very clear as to what they mean ie the gold transfer overall great functionality though think about what you want to happen in the app as the user is on an adventure,0,47
674,you said tooltips could be helpful in this case to point out what a particular section actually means remember that apps are being designed for a mobile context as such hover text doesnt really exist,0,35
1098,development plan requested changes from last weeks comments were not made,0,11
1099,very impressive changes to the app since last week however this team consistently overlooks the importance of written portions of the assignment and fails to make requested changes if you are having trouble with this please see me in office hours or post on piazza,0,45
672,there was no context for duration while entering the detail of an activity it is used nowhere in the application 3   violation of consistency if you ask for a length of time and its not used in the app then theres a problem,0,43
673,adding a location and timing option for each class added would be helpful currently the user has to navigate into a specific class to delete it it would be much easier if the delete option was there on the main page that lists the classes 2  again flexibility and efficiency of use,0,52
1533,ended up adding a club to favorites twice somehow,0,9
1418,edit added points back,0,4
1419,while it is good to ab test small changes dont be afraid to make significant changes this week to your styling while youre in good shape i think your app could see some significant improvements in minimalism and ease of navigation whenever you find yourself thinking that your app is just inherently complex question that assumption,0,56
1410,observations great detail on the protocol,0,6
1411,alternative design testing good that you accounted for the sell button tests dependence on a user actually wanting to sell something i would definitely recommend performing analysis on the data from each of the alternatives separately as well as combined,0,40
1412,overall good progress hope everyones midterms went well,0,8
1413,are your analytics hooked up to actual user behavior or just canned data id encourage you to keep refining what you show people by going back to your original pov and asking what visualizations can help people address your original problem,0,41
1414,also your ab test needs to look at user behavior not what they report in a survey chsquared tests are for comparing rates of binary behavior such as click through not ratings on a likert scale,0,36
1416,a couple thoughts on your ab test will you be able to test the value of historical results if you are just giving people canned data for those results i agree that showing history could be valuable but question whether you can get accurate test results just by showing fake data for people also for the employees move away from aggregating results in a pie chart  to timeseries graph most likely a line chart since people are more likely to want to see trends in their responses over time  eg why did i give low ratings last month rather than just knowing that 30 of all their responses were in a particular category youre getting there but think a little more about how you show employees and employers the results and how you help them reflect on those results go back to your original pov for fresh inspiration,0,148
1417,url doesnt work for redesign resubmit via piazza resubmit the data type you will measure and discuss the possible outcomes of the test and the interpretations only then will i give points back,0,33
1322,how will you grab the users login name to have that render as you versus marks name,0,17
1323,the confirmation page seems to need a little love eg more efficient use of white space,0,16
1320,how do i know where to meet my group re confirmation,0,11
1321,what does it mean that someone is pending in my lunch group,0,12
1326,error when trying to register error could not resolve register from state splash,0,13
1327,signing in with soundcloud is awesome ,0,6
1324,its really cool to see this come together  still some implementationfunctionality that doesnt yet exist eg pause vote to skip just skips  doesnt seem to increment voting if theres no song in the queue and the user tries to skip there is no user feedback besides what is printed in the console,0,52
1325,when using across multiple devices i could join the same room awesome work  yet some other things dont quite hold the mute and pause buttons arent visible on mobile device music didnt seem to want to play on phone even though could see the time incrementing  note the app does work on a phone just doesnt have full functionality  please ensure so in next assignment ,0,65
1328,when the join room fails it simply states join room failed how can we provide more helpful information for the user to know how to recover for this error eg navigation back to safetysplash page,0,35
1329,lastly the view files are not in handlebars but in html  this should not be the case,0,17
1531,i like the concept of being able to create and answer quiz questions looking forward to your presentation,0,18
1256,some of these notes are borderline bugs  please sort them out,0,11
1255,notes why does the value for the amount of people you are with have to be greater than 1 what if user is traveling alone,0,25
1252,awesome work with the camera seems a little buggy  so after i take a photo i see a little preview of it but then when i go to hit upload it takes me too addpicture but the screen is not scrollable and i cant see if my image was uploaded on mobile device,0,53
1253,happy to chat more in office hours if yall have any questions,0,12
1250,after user creates an account the app reads welcome back even though its their first time in the app,0,19
1251,when navigating throughout the app the hamburger button disappears eg edittripdiary  this is confusing  can you keep the button on all pages or not use it in the first place would make navigation more straightforward,0,35
1528,online test results testing is hard nice to see you documented all the difficulties and bumps along the road the drastic difference between actual user preferences and data is pretty intense but yes i would agree that a lot of the variance you all found is probably caused by some other factors in the experiment as a whole conclusions and analysis could in general be a little bit more clear especially with two different tests run little descriptions of what the original and what the variation was would be useful,0,90
1529,missing github repo url,1,4
1258,work load seems a bit uneven in previous week  but looking more even in future weeks so keep this up,0,20
309,good job overall the 2nd photo didnt have a breakdown description some of the needs listed were also a bit redundant,1,21
300,only 8 user needs provided,0,5
304,good observations but lacking description of breakdowns and design opportunities both in your observations and your photos,0,17
305,observations need to be more than pure observationsthey need to demonstrate breakdowns or successes,0,14
307,creative topic and good needfinding,0,5
470,inspiration board does not discuss how some of the inspirations fall short for the need you are addressing,0,18
471,try chatting with someone who prefers to eat alone  why is this the case might be a hard thing to have someone open up about as they might feel vulnerable so proceed with care,0,34
1443,you have many implementation tasks set for next week and i have also suggested many make sure you set a realistic plan that also takes into account the most important tasks and the required tasks for a9,0,37
476,not a human centered point of view our focus is people not books a human centered point of view will start with the phrase personcommunity needs a way to  or some equivalent as an example,0,35
959,development plan your plan should include due dates even if tentative also should include outside commitments and constraints for each member ie midterms parttime jobs other classes etc otherwise a welllaid out plan,0,33
958,your brief revisit jumps back and forth between the two prototypes and is confusing,0,14
951,prototype im really impressed with the effort you put into redesigning your idea and paper prototyping i think you were able to glean insights that you were stuck on before and it seems that youre more confident in your idea now the simplistic design is great the only thing that its missing is a log out button but this can be implemented for future assignments the interactions are still a bit clunky and illdefined in terms of the symbols also the back button and help button seem to be stretched in the web version,0,94
950,development plan great development plan i really liked that you included stretch goals and a discoveries section,0,17
953,prototype i loved the animation very creative and wellimplemented early in this stage the navigation overall is very simplistic and well thought out a couple suggestions the scrolling mission log is overwhelming might be useful to collapse them and make them individually expandable the mission frequency circles were misaligned when resized to mobile so it was a bit confusing to know which frequency is chosen when i hit enter after entering a subtask i was expecting to be able to create another subtask but was sent straight into my mission even though i hadnt finished writing out my tasks as a bonus you might want to also add a time component to a due date so that users can also set what time a task is due,0,127
952,development plan the screenshot provided was really blurry when zoomed in and difficult to read but i judged it based on your description good accounting for vacations assignments etc,0,29
955,he changes were all future changes,0,6
954,development plan very nicely broken down tasks in your plan you will want to include any outside constraints coming up as well ie midterms other projects jobs etc,0,28
956,development plan should have immediately actionable items eg logistics page does not suffice generally an actionable item will have a verb and specific object such as setup html skeleton for logistics page,0,32
1442,possible outcomes of ab tests are not interpreted with implications of design of prototype ie how will your redesign affect the tests,0,22
477,in a rapidly changing society universities need to promote selflearning however a student who has just finished a class isnt necessarily thinking about learning more on the subject by leading them towards resources that our in close proximity such as our underutilized library we can promote more selflearning and prepare students for their future,0,54
1440,your implementation is a bit behind what happens after the user orders  when an order is complete how does the user pick up the food a simple address would suffice again wizardofoz work is fine but it should still allow a user to fully complete a goal getting food in this case there is no way to pay not even a fake pay now button and no way to get your food i would like to see an example of an order with a status of complete to know what are the next steps also you added ratings to the dishes but did not implement a rating system in short tie up all loose ends,0,115
1261,great idea to have team meetings embedded within the dev plan,0,11
1260,what is meant to happen when user clicks on friends profile page currently there is no functionality for this,0,19
714,good job  points off for severity ratings not being quite accurate enough many of the issues you highlighted should have been rated higher team feedback provided v general solutions though i do think the suggestion made was right on this app needed better navigation,0,44
710,deductions for  no explicit comparisons made between the two prototypes in your individual feedback,0,14
661,summary not very in depth for the amount of detail in both hes,1,13
1069,competitive analysis could have gone deeper but i like the comparison to analog solutions need access to plan provide editing privileges to master copy so i can just scroll through the history i remember you guys having really detailed action items before but no longer,0,45
1068,condensing that create new event form will lower costs a ton,0,11
1061,navigation is inconsistentlacking why does the top menu disappear in the profile,0,12
1060,your development plan does not include actual hours spent  this is a very important column please add,0,17
1063,beware on focusing too much on stretch goals or setting too many goals as you missed some this week,0,19
1062,good work for the synchronous whiteboard,0,6
1065,im guessing in the profile page the mood genres etc will be editable somehow,0,14
1064,focus on interactive functionality over splash page animation about page,0,10
1067,theres too much on the page think about the minimalism heuristic perhaps show groupscalendar shouldnt be in the side menu but a persistent menu that is always visible app mostly has a flowing feel but constantly having to open the side menu is hindering,0,44
1066,competitive analysis doesnt comprehensively cover the features mentioned for example how does your apps voting feature differ from other voting apps,0,21
1669,overall your app has progressed a lot over the quarter and its super cool to see it where it is now i like that you scripted in pauses into your pitch,0,31
1668,great job today slide could have been a litttttle cleaner background is a tad cluttereddisorientating,0,15
1666,    the design of the application elegantly addresses the stated user needs 2 points,0,13
593,the severity ratings are sometimes off  for example id say the missing collaborator screen should be a 4,0,18
592,im not sure how the missing show path button is related to aesthetics and minimalist designno points deducted,0,18
595,some more comparison between the two prototypes would have been helpful,1,11
1409,i can tell a lot of thought and work was put into some proposed redesigns though good work,0,18
1408,alternative designsexperiments in general you have a lot of proposed experiments they can work together but just make sure that this is planned carefully be ready to explain that any experiments you run in parallel dont interfere with each other and potentially mess up each others data,0,47
1403,observations great detail with the protocol whew its been quite an adventure with these naming conventions to avoid future issues with this maybe consider some alternative ways to represent who is providing a favr for who i remember some directional arrows toward the beginning of the quarter perhaps some variant of this might help metaphors to the real world   recognition over recall are good baselines for some sort of quick redesign here,0,72
1402,in general i dont think this is the most valuable alternate design that you could be tackling with ab testing shrinking information down to one screen seems just like a simple interface improvement i would consider thinking about some different alternative designs to test there are a lot of other big opportunities from your user observations different ways to fill out event information different ways to view your list of events etc,0,72
1401,changes for the location since youre already working with apis it may be useful to look into google placeslocation to simply autocomplete locations can make that part a whole lot smoother,0,31
1400,observations great detail i like how you considered and documented the background of each tester gives it a much more human feel,0,22
1407,observations good detail on your protocol nice insight and appropriate list of changes good job,0,15
1406,alternative design interesting choice for ab test i might even consider some different wording to make the contrast even larger it seems like youre going for implicit action result vs very explicit action result that describes exactly what clicking the button will do cant decide click me is still pretty open ended and also might deter someone who isnt necessarily indecisive but would still be interested in a random suggestion perhaps something very direct like give me a random or show me idk something very directly descriptive to make the contrast bigger between the two designs up to you just some food for thought,0,104
1405,the posttest redesign of your app is definitely an improvement for navigation  nice work,0,14
1404,observations detailed protocol and cool inclusion of survey results,0,9
1546,looking forward to the last round of updates for the final,1,11
449,pick on functionality study or eating and improve that ps the studying app has been done even more times than the eating app,1,23
1339,missing current weeks dev plan,0,5
1338,explicitly state what the hypotheses areeg null hypothesis,1,8
1547,many of the changes are more aesthetic rather than focusing on functionality one thing to clarify is what happens with the app while the user is on an adventure or what happens during a boss fight great functionality and design looking forward to your presentation,0,45
443,for the point of view the solution is too specific and youve left out how personal informatics save the day you did identify a need to save time vs money,0,30
441,it prevents people from feeling punished from being there early positive reinforcement for arriving early  interesting insight,0,17
446,prototypes relate to storyboard and point of view but again the point of view needs refining,0,16
445,storyboard 2 is actually on to something with personal informatics,0,10
444,inspiration is ok but theyre focusing too much on a specific solution that doesnt fit entirely with the brief,0,19
1520,your app is absolutely adorable and i love the idea i think you should emphasize the tastebuddy being a cooking companion more because i think that would hit upon your pov better i look forward to your presentation,0,38
1542,changesfit  finish great progress overall things are looking a lot more polished up and functional perhaps one last touch feature addition to make things look even more real is the ability to add a picture for the profile so its not just a sea of mes  i wasss very entertained by the pictures though,0,54
38,good ideas from thorough ideation and iteration interview really tells a story,0,12
1540,if mission log is empty it might be nice to have a simple message saying no current missions add more or something of that nature just so the entire middle of the screen isnt just blank  when creating a mission it isnt clear which button is the runner or the resource having a label of some sort or a placeholder image there might be more useful for the user to prevent confusion when i tried clicking run after adding all my tasks and objectives a box that said starting mission came up but nothing happened after that,0,97
33,where are questions great effort like the web way to brainstorm,0,11
32,missing questions,2,2
31,sketchprototype stage separation,0,3
37,prototype and sketch should be separate,0,6
36,great job try to brainstorm more ideas and connect them more with your interview,0,14
34,the response to the video need to be questions not just comments,0,12
641,well done points off because the comparisons drawn between the two prototypes were somewhat limited,0,15
640, instances where you listed heuristic violations for app 1 but not app 2 but still provided comparisons discussing both if there is an issue in both apps then they should both be described before drawing comparisons,0,36
643,did not employ at least 8 of the 10 heuristics,0,10
1246,notes uneven distribution of tasks  from the looks of it hyeonsu taking on uneven large amount of work how can we distribute the tasks more evenly happy to meet to discuss strategies with your group let me know,0,38
649,a little liberal on giving 4 ratings to issues that were not catastrophic failures,0,14
1539,you had a very unique metric that you analyzed and you did well at analyzing and interpreting it looking forward to your presentation,0,23
339,several needs were redundanteg 3 and 11 andor was articulated as a feature,0,13
335,class talk wasnt well prepared,0,5
334,some needs were solutions not needs such as simple quizzes to let user learn more about saving energy,0,18
337,the observation plan described is relevant to empathy by talking about connecting us to more people in our lives however observations 2 and 3 dont touch upon that perhaps having an interview with someone who had been wished a happy birthday would give both perspectives and tiein to the idea of connecting people,0,53
336,finding design opportunities doesnt mean come up with an app rather it means identifying a pain point or a missed opportunity in the observation that could improve the activity your breakdown descriptions such as  it is quite difficult to draw out a nicelooking and easily understood emoji were better no points deducted,0,52
331,some user needs arent related to brief youre headed towards certain solutions but i just dont see that clearly in the writing brief explanation is too vague too,0,28
330,your description of corys breakdown sounds more like a design opportunity this was actually true of your second breakdown as well some of your needs presuppose a solution ie 15,0,30
333,duplicate needs such as 13 and 11 or 4 and 13,0,11
332,the observation plan and observations arent related to the studio brief,0,11
1026,competitive analysis no comparison to other apps on the market you should explicitly state what other types of workout apps are doing and why yours is different or better,0,29
8,sketch separately from prototype brainstorm more,0,6
948,your paragraph is mostly a factual recounting and doesnt provide much reflection on the projects trajectory how has the core idea of supporting emoji use changed over the course evaluateexplain that core need more deeply,0,35
949,prototype home screen is still a bit lacking in including a mental model as to what the app is and how it works great work on the profile and help pages navigation is mostly all there one minor suggestion would be to allow the user to move out of the hamburger menu by clicking outside it rather than having to click on the menu again one thing you mentioned you implemented was error prevention in the listing of ingredients but it didnt seem evident yet  good implementation of changes from your hes,1,92
946,the implemented screens arent the functional priorities especially the about page,0,11
947,the login button disappears when anywhere other than the home page navigation menu doesnt work when in feed page about changes to about us when in about page,0,28
945,owners needs to be a single person and needs to be assigned to all tasks clarify external constraints such as other projectsmidterms,0,22
942,revisit missing discussion of concrete changes made to the project throughout these first few weeks of the design process,0,19
943,you can put time spent on the assignment itself eg compiling into pdf writing revisit the  brief paragraph account for every task you do,0,24
940,plan focus on having more specific tasks a good rule of thumb to go by is immediately actionable you seem to have a lot of broad tasks that can definitely be broken down  a lot of your main pages are just listed as one single item but there are probably multiple elements that are involved in those pages you can either be more specific in the task or break them down into subtasks otherwise the task becomes a multilayer of figuring out what to do and then actually doing it not immediately actionable,0,93
133,user needs are not application based  the assignment asked to list the needs not solutions that could be used to address the needs,0,23
132,missing third picture,0,3
131,surprisingly i found out that two of my participants prefer not to use their phones unless necessary to find their way to places  great,0,24
130,good job  1 bc your talk went long,0,8
137,needs some redundancies in needs try to be more critical of what you observed and dig for the deep motivations that cause what you saw,0,25
136,needs are expressed too much as specific solutions or features,0,10
135,make more explicit connection in the observations to how the stories affected the user and caused them to empathize with the original poster we want more than a factual recounting of your observation,0,33
138,nice work some user needs are framed as user wants  these are very different things,0,15
707,strive to include more depth in your analyses and evlauations  also a login page is not a home page,0,19
89,prototype could be more complete to help simulate the experience with a partner to receive feedback in line with that want to avoid explicit floating labeling of what things do on a prototype,0,33
82,brainstorming focus on a larger number of diverse concepts brainstorm,0,10
83,prototype for an application should be something that a user testing would be interacting with,0,15
80,as a follow up can you think about the downsides to designing such a general purpose appprogram with a lot of users it would be attractive and work well what might you encounter when trying to get the initial batch of users,0,42
81,a lot of this doesnt seem very well connected to a freshman experience,0,13
1658,pitch poster walkthrough application  all fantastic,0,6
1659,keep designing keep building ,0,4
1388,the photos show and the captions thoroughly describe clear breakdowns or opportunities  captions do not articulate breakdown please read over rubric to ensure youre getting all points,0,27
1650,thanks for a great quarter  im happy you were able to find an idea that worked out really well for you,0,21
1651,slide didnt really demonstrate the app interface but you all did a great job with this unique app and idea  ive truly enjoyed watching this idea grow and you have all been through so much work thanks for a great quarter ,0,41
1656,congratulations on the award,0,4
1657,amazing job on each category and just in general throughout the quarter i was consistently impressed by your teams efforts and dedication to the design cycle,0,26
1654,great job today i think the main area that could have been improved on overall was more distinguishing as a unique solution,0,22
586,thorough but would be helpful if your analysis of each point were a little more concise,0,16
587,very detailed and you did a good job rating the severity of the issues appropriately,0,15
584,more depth to feedback,0,4
580,provide more feedback,0,3
588,good job overall some of the feedback could have been more comprehensive as to providing them with potential solutions,0,19
1633,walkthrough went to 2 minutes could have simply demonstrated the postingemoji translation feature,0,13
1436,what are the hypotheses being tested at least make the null hypothesis explicit,0,13
1437,protocol could be better but gave point no real descriptions from the photo captions outcomes provided but no interpretations time is proposed as a measure but no statistical test resubmit on piazza your interpretations and corrections regarding statistics and ill give the points back,0,44
1435,i think fundamentally you identify that your game interface needs work but the proposed changes arent quite comprehensive to fix the issues,0,22
1432,the protocol is not detailed enough,0,6
1433,suggested changes dont address core issues of the cooking interface,0,10
1430,describe the null hypothesis explicitly,0,5
1431,i had to take a few points off for the testing descriptions the assignment asks what measurable user behavior you will be tracking describing a difference in general isnt specific enough also there was no description of the possible outcomes of these particular tests that youre trying to run,0,49
1380,documentation awesome seeing that level of detail video was great too very interesting find noticing how much the keyboard on a phone can actually affect usability a lot of these breakdowns i actually did not even notice while briefly using your app  good stuff the power of user observations,0,49
1438,the protocol should be specific enough that if another person were to read it they could run a participant through the app great functionality on the redesign i really enjoy the trading card system and the reroll functionality the only thing that i would still suggest is having a way for users to add their own chores or cards the detailed functionality of this can be wizardofozed if needed missing last weeks dev plan and github url for redesign,0,79
1541,test results good discussion of data collecting and analysis process,0,10
1348,comments i like the addition of the colorful screen suggestion after log in redirect to the web app not the login page,0,22
459,this point of view addresses a specific  aspect of social networkingcreating a deeper connection and a particular directionsharing privately while mentioning the human need,0,24
450,your point of view was explained better in your description than your actual pov section a more specifically worded pov might bethis is just an example of a similar but not necessarily the same direction live music concert attendees lack a way to share and get information causing confusion for the attendees crowdsourcing information while the event is ongoing will help spread information to more attendees,0,66
451,this point of view has a specific aspect of concerts that it tackleslack of information and a particular directioncrowdsourcing also it doesnt mention a specific implementationa mobile web application,0,29
1343,the ab test was not specific enough as described and doesnt account for hypotheses or interpretations of results really liked the videos i think they capture your users breakdowns much better than pictures or captions could have,0,37
1345,at least make your null hypothesis explicit,0,7
456,storyboard doesnt lead to a prototype that someone else could build,0,11
457,in the second storyboard why does anna need to share her college life experience the need is not set up also reduce text by actually showing all of anna sarah and amy with a happy face instead of a paragraph at the last panel,0,44
654,it was not always clear how your critique was tied to the heuristics for example having to log into the app rather than getting an email is not recognition over recall persay but an issue of engagement,0,37
655,great organization of your individual he,0,6
658,your feedback was clear overall and to the point well done,0,11
516,comments the point of view does not include a user perspective i shouldn—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎt have to infer the user from the pov it should come right out and say it you need a more specific point of view and demonstrable user need in order to tailor your design accordingly right now you are making assumptions about what people generally might need try thinking back to personas see scott—ç’Îç’‘’ù’ÇÎs videos from week 2 and developing one or two example users for your app,0,81
1376,another thing to consider is do you want to minimize rerolls or minimize time spent to decide on a place to go someone spending 3 rerolls on the single result page might actually be taking less time to find a place to eat than someone spending 1 reroll on a multiresult page just a thought,0,55
322,photocaption 3 not a very clear connection to where the breakdowndesign opportunity is,0,13
323,needs a few of these are surface levelredundant and would not be quite critical enough to serve as a basis for a design project,0,24
320,photo 3 in a similar fashion as the comment above photocaption 3 does not clearly demonstrate connection to a breakdowndesign opportunity,0,21
321,very interesting topic and great job going after a diverse set of learning activities this problem space is pretty big so if you end up pursuing something in this direction as a full project i would advise to stick to a smaller target group like specifically for guitar players or specifically for those interesting in computer science concepts this will help a lot with narrowing down what belongs in the designs etc,0,72
326,well done some needs articulated as solutionsfeatures in particular need 5 jerry needs a way to easily type in new workout logs,0,22
327,the breakdown for joseph sounds more like a necessity of doing schoolwork than a real breakdown 3rd photo did not show a clear breakdowndesign opportunity,0,25
324,would like to see more specifics about what you observed and how,0,12
325,overall welldone the third picture doesnt show a breakdown or design opportunity i know you say that jeremy needs to work consistently without feeling tired and pressured but you dont address the fact that earlier he says that he uses this time pressure as a way to motivate himself to finish his work it seems like theres more to understand here about why he works the way he does and how his situation might be improved,0,76
328,many of your needs assume a solution for example 1 says user needs an application why do they need an application your answer to that question is what should be written down,0,32
329,many of your needs were redundant you seem to be using breakdown and design opportunity interchangeably a breakdown would be the specific point at which something goes differently from the users expectation a design opportunity is just an idea based on your observations for a problem that needs to be addressed none of these should be too specific about how the need is addressed at this stage,0,67
1340,deductions  1 point off for the limited number of changes listed the changes to be implemented should be a larger list of the general feedback you received from your inperson testing not just the relatively small interface changes that you are making for your ab testing,0,46
1594,poster is not 24x30 portrait poster doesnt provide any competitive analysis,2,11
1341,your description of your online test does not describe what you will be measuring specifically just that you will be testing the impact of an add a class button will you be comparing click through rates on the current add a class button or will you be calculating the total amount of time spent on the page,0,57
1598,presentation was creative and definitely memorable but the beginning part could have been rehearsed bettercut short,0,16
995,app one huge piece of the skeleton and flow that i dont quite see is organization pages i imagine organizations would have some info to be able to be drilled into via list of orgs and maybe even in your profile for orgs that youve matched into how is that part of the app going to be navigated to and fro seems important especially if a big part of your app is to connect people to orgs for interaction not just matching some notes from studio feedback on yes  feedback on no weird button names after adding something to your interests system status on how many orgs you need to cycle through,0,112
994,plan a good amount of specific steps be careful with some of the tasks you want them to be as immediately actionable as possible  for example develop movement between screens of the app could be more specific in what that means otherwise it would require extra mini tasks beforehand to figure out what that movement means before actually doing the implementation  same goes for creating skeleton pages for pages we might need  can we be more specific here,0,78
997,plan nice plan keep working with immediately actionable tasks,0,9
996,revisit would have liked to see more discussion of concrete insightchanges throughout iteration in the design cycle a lot of this seems like fluff that isnt too specific to your teams experience working through to this current point  what in needfinding he and prototyping led you to making a better app your initial idea was matching a person to a club right now the model also looks like the main actions are to match someone up or view a list what is it in your idea now that illustrates the new experience you are hoping to design you mention interacting and connecting with organizations but thats still very vague,0,109
991,plan pretty solid plan keep working with specific immediately actionable tasks moving forward it might actually be useful to add another column that categorizes which pages the work is to be done on since it appears youre already making that distinction in all the tasks i like that you have tasks outside of just development like finding design inspirations,0,59
990,he changes good job im particularly interested to see how the twitter follower model will turn out  really good to think about how other models work to decide on how to build your own youre probably already thinking about these but dont forget to also consider some of the smaller he evaluations like wording flow with actions etc,0,58
993,revisit nice discussion about reaching the two main target audiences on both sides of the exchange these two groups will be very important to always keep in mind as the app is worked on,0,34
999,some thoughts  work with the right most icon star a bit  may not represent what a user would expect it to represent,0,22
998,app good progress so far as noted in studio i like how to tested with different amounts of user input  keep that up  think about input validationdisplaying etc,0,28
121,sketch should be separate from the prototype no questions or reflection component,0,12
123,assignment is missing many of the components such as the interview sketch and reflection components,0,15
124,finally graded d,0,3
125,questions missing please turn them in by 226,0,8
126,had to take 2 points off because i didnt see your reflection questions for the video,0,16
127,prototype idea was a bit generic tried to solve all problems and very similar to existing ucsd app but otherwise good i didnt see your video questions in the online submission let me know if i should check your physical submission,0,41
128,questions missing seem to have strength in ideating and sketching out ideas,0,12
129,prototype did not reflect the pov from your interviews good insights about the struggles of international students,0,17
1645,i like your identified need pointing out that there are things that are hard to articulate as a google search the walkthrough and pitch were a little unpolished but really glad to see your progress this quarter,0,37
1644,awesome pitch nice poster,0,4
1647,thanks for a great quarter  i am very happy to have seen how your project has grown throughout the past 10 weeks,0,22
1646,very very impressed by the creativity functionality and overall cuteness of this app you all did such a great job with the app and the presentation best pitch award woo thanks for a great quarter ,0,35
1641,your poster had a little too much text to make it easy to scan i like your clear user need but wanted to see a little more development along the lines of the studio supporting reflection in ways other than just seeing the historical answers,0,45
1640,slide hard to read pitch not unique or creative walkthrough could have been better rehearsed but its still pretty good,0,20
1649,great job with everything this quarter i have truly enjoyed watching this app grow from the inception of its idea to the full implementation thanks for a great quarter ,0,29
1648,thank you for a wonderful quarter  you all did such a great job with the functionality and ive really enjoyed seeing your app grow and become what it is,1,29
579,go deeper with feedback make clearer link to heuristics,0,9
570,it was clear that your points related to the heuristics but you need to make it explicit 15 violations by 1 no comparisons between prototypes,0,25
576,severity ratings make sure youre looking over the rubric before submitting,1,11
575,some of the violations could be elaborated on further as to why it was a usability issue also needs an explicit comparative analysis of the two prototypes,0,27
574,really nicely done,0,3
1209,functionality i dont think its quite fully ready for user testing yet the functionality doesnt feel complete enough to really see exchange in action i would like to see a user being able to offer up something to teach and another user to be able to jump in and see that listing being able to actually drop each other messages would be extra awesome but given the amount of time having your faked message page works well in general i think you want to play around more with using sever persistent data to make a lot of the functionality come to life,0,102
1208,is rate per hour,0,4
1421,assignment was incorrect about suitable variable for chi squared so point was given you must convert your number of pageviews to a different variable that classifies the users into one of two categories since its confusion youre after maybe just classify users based on whether or not they went to the edit page after they added hard to understand exactly what youre after you can also use pageviews and a ttest to compare the groups that way up to you redesign is not functional currently dont really see the difference between the two urls,0,94
1420,protocol not very thorough gave point for chosen data because the assignment was misleading just change the data type to number of users who accessed help out of those assigned to either condition and youre good,0,36
1423,great visual design and cute concept,0,6
1422,ab testing should have hypotheses of results and potential interpretations great redesign,0,12
1424,great functionality so far coming up to the end here very thorough assignment clicking to change the due time on a small mobile screen might be a little difficult using the arrows missing copy of last weeks dev plan and github url,0,42
1427, you didnt group your information about testing and how it would be performed in one place it was sprinkled throughout the submission made for challenging grading if you have time before todays submission please try to make sure that pieces of info,0,42
1426,comments  nice new landing page ,0,5
1429,the ab test is quite shallow of a change  a change in the photo taking page might be more interesting as there were definite confusions from users after using the page and several redesigns could be possible from that issueno points deducted,0,42
1428, i dont see liz or marias signed consent forms,0,9
730,a couple violations missing a severity rating even if thees no usability issue there place a rating of 0 on it so the team is aware that this is clearly not an issue in their prototype in the heuristics that only contained a comparative analysis i would have liked to see individual statements about the separate prototypes,0,57
732,looking forward to seeing how you diverge your application away from replicating yelp4square,0,13
735,well done good comparative analysis of the two prototypes and addressing potential solutions,0,13
734,overall well done but the formatting made it a bit tough to follow based on others in your group there were violations in the categories you presented for both apps but you only described issues in one app or the other,0,41
737,in general the feedback couldve drawn more comparisons between the two prototypes,0,12
736,grading still in progress,0,4
1359,both createanimal and createanimaltext links went to createanimaltext but otherwise everything looks good you have hit upon some great insights and it is clear that you have taken these insights to make tangible changes,0,34
469,prototype 1 is strong  nice work  prototype 2 is too similar to 1 be sure to think outside of the box especially if youre doing an event app as this has been done many times before,0,36
468,storyboard 1  please post complete storyboard as discussed on piazza via private post  ensure that future submission contain all required material,0,21
1353,good redesign,0,2
461,first storyboard has a shallow user need i need to see peoples photos is not a human centered need second storyboard does not demonstrate an implementable prototype,0,27
463,pov does not articulate connection to studio brief or a user need,0,12
1273,deductions  point off for complete functionality i cant add a class to any past classes each button to a previous quarter is a placeholder for an empty screen,0,28
1519,good to see the progress and the deep thinking about the testing and the results however your expected results were not calculated correctly use the rate of conversion from version a as your expected values in version b not just assume that everyone will convert,0,45
1518,wanted to see deeper analysis of what the results imply beyond just wanting more test subjects also did not see any suggestions for changes based on your ab test or any of your proposed changes added to your dev plan  still some development to do but i think you can make the changes you suggested in the next week and polish your analytics page are you planning to hook up the analytics to reflect any of peoples actual reading activity,0,80
1514,missing last weeks development plan,0,5
1517,really great testing your prototype is almost there but i was hoping to see the analytics and rankings pages update when you walk around a building or at least that the name there would reflect the name on the account also there was a bug where some of the values showed as nan,0,53
1274,point off for look and feel is reflective of a finished prototype this kind of goes hand in hand with the previous one the placeholder pages for quarters need work right now too much appears to unfinished,0,37
1735,great rap as usual haha love the creativity,0,8
1275,comments  well done getting all the classes from the ucsd site,0,11
357,overall great detail with observations in both the commentary and photoscaptions i think its a good start to figuring out the needs of this particular activity it would have been extra helpful to have some more observation on how these people communicated with those who they share the space with to see what kinds of workarounds they typically engage in,0,60
356,needs a lot of redundancies and a lot of needs that are very surface level based on the discussion i have written above try to think about what people really need from the activity of schedule exchange not so much what they really need from current implemented interfaces,0,48
354,needs a few redundancies,0,4
353,photos photossketch and caption should demonstrate a breakdown or design opportunity not just any scene in the story,0,18
352,also be careful to detail how your observation process goes earlier on in the document in seems like most were observed but one had used a diary,0,27
351,very interesting problem space of personal instructors to consider some things to think about would be how other professional teaching exchange systems work instructors for hire from official intuitions perhaps one way to increase the reliability on both sides of the tutor and student would be to even just give it a facade of being a professional system rather than an under the table transaction could it be that both parties dont really work as professionally because having the same peer status undermines professional respect would be interesting to find out the answer to that,0,95
350,needs a number of redundancies in needs what are the true motivationsneeds that cause these users to do what they do,0,21
359,overall you did a great job with your observations and commentary this is a great problem space that will undoubtably be relevant for a long time good detail on exactly where the pitfalls were for people in this application process in the scope of this assignment it makes sense to limit your activity to the scope of one application process since it would be trivial to try to cover all types of application systems however in the future it may be useful to include some explanation validating the use of one particular process to study the activity as a whole again in the scope of this assignment not as big of a concernwasnt required,3,114
358,needs theres a number of redundancies in the needs listed they could also be a little bit more critical of the activity and what insightful things you observed dig deeper for core motivations for example  what different reasons and motivations cause people to act differently in shared spaces when at school dorms vs family homes are there needs here that might open up interesting design opportunities,0,66
1447,observationschanges great detail i like the thorough notes and clear connection to changes insightful find on users wanting to just jump to search rather than manually checking through categories,0,29
1446,good progress nice to see that the prototype is fitting better into mobile form factor,0,15
1445,photo documentation i like that you included quotes from the user testing in the captions really helps make the documented data feel more human and relatable later when digging for insights,0,31
288,nice work itd be great to see more outside of the box thinking when it comes to transportation  get creative,0,20
1444,changes interesting that it was not obvious to someone that the app was geared toward ucsd will be cool to see how the experience of the app might change when you do make that more obvious,0,36
281,good topic only thing is that the 3rd photo and caption doesnt really show a breakdown,0,16
280,good needfinding,0,2
283,on the right track just needed a few more photos ideas and clearer description of your observations,0,17
282,creative topic and good needfinding i liked the three personas you used,0,12
285,no photosbreakdowns described,0,3
284,looks good just need another interview and a few more ideas,0,11
287,user needs are framed as user wants  these are very different things so ensure to distinguish them in future assignments moreover each want is prefaced with students  observing three people does not make for generalizable data across the entire student body,0,41
1441,if you test the duration spent on a page do not use a chisquare test unless variables can be binarized ie clicked vs not clicked points will be taken off next week if tests are performed incorrectly ab tests on duration will typically use ttests ps  in industry chisquare tests are used much more often,0,55
263,ensure to not articulate needs as solutions  second photos description does not articulate a formulated breakdown,1,16
262,well done you didnt give an explanation even a short one about how your observed activity related to the brief,0,20
261,your breakdowns and needs are too focused on the solution that you want to create,0,15
260,great work only thing is that your 2nd photo didnt clearly demonstrate a breakdown it wasnt clear what the student was doing or what was on his screen,0,28
265,in response to your question  how they would curate  travel route remember how someone would do something can be very different to how they actually do something  in future user testing ensure you are making this distinction also ensure that needs are not articulated as solutions,0,46
269,nice work  take care to not articulate needs as solutions,1,10
268,great work with the interviews and observations while there are 15 needs presented satisfying rubric criteria seems as if there is the potential for more of the box needfinding which i look forward to reading about in future assignments,0,39
1562,its good that you noticed some of the confusions with the app and are actively trying to fix them these specific changes should be noted in your dev plan think about why your app is unique in order to include that in your pitch next week looking forward to your presentation,0,51
1563,you cannot use chi squared test on continuous data such as time a ttest is the appropriate test to use here,0,21
1564,the result of the controlthe a scenario should actually be the expected where did you get the expected numbers 720 and 2142 you cant conclude from the chi squared that version a is the winning version the best conclusion you can make is that a and b version are not different with 76 confidence,0,54
1565,most of your proposed changes are surface level changes,0,9
1567,great job at your app and presentation im very happy that you all found this creative idea and implemented it so well  it was great having yall in my studio ,0,30
988,your development plan items need to be immediately actionable eg logo is not an immediately actionable item draw 5 candidate sketches for logo makes clear what the necessary action is owner should be a single person include outside constraints such as other projects or midterms as part of your weekly budget,0,51
989,your idea regarding anonymity and collaboration needs to be exploredexplained further as very often anonymity actually drives away empathy,0,19
982,he violations with a 0 severity rating dont need to be mentioned in your list deductions for navigation  there was some confusion as what was intended by different screens when reviewing after your presentation  paragraph does not state explicitly what your app does which makes it hard to see how it is connected to the brief the paragraph says what you did prototypingstoryboarding but not how those processes affected your final designhow your design changed over time,0,77
983,navigational flow still needs some more thought youre showing the input screen and the results o f inputting an entry on the same sreen at once which means youre not thinking about how things are laid out before anything has been input,0,42
980,re rob haitani video watched today in lecture  dont put redundant information when screen real estate is so limited eg housing jobs schools buttons directly above housing jobs schools  if you think they arent redundant then make this more obvious,0,40
981,no third screen is present therefore lacking both functionality and navigation,0,11
986,development plan is a little too sparse and each item should be an immediately actionable item for example work towards interactiveprototype is not an actionable thing that you can sit down and start on,0,34
987,each item should have a single owner even if everyone will contribute this ensures that someone is accountable and personally responsible for seeing work for it gets done,0,28
984,more effort put on functionality than on navigation here a few points off for the navigation lacking flow but otherwise overall good,0,22
985,your he evaluations were thorough and reflect the evaluators experiences at a deeper than surface level good job,0,18
115,good video  questions i recommend checking out dan russels seminar this spring when it is announced in class because he covers both of these questions really well dans work actually involves observing people in their own homes in an unobtrusive manner to observe as realistic behavior as possible,0,48
114,i like the idea of making the org page more of a portal worth revisiting instead of a static list,0,20
117,i like the very unique approach to interviewing the freshman though most people focus on asking about the negatives but you chose to inquire more on the positives,0,28
116,prototype to get the best results out of testing a prototype you wouldnt want external labels and explanations of how it works otherwise the feedback given back from the user might be a little too informed,0,36
111,good to see divergent ideas eg not just a similar solution over and over within each interview though your inclass and freshman interviews tended toward similar ideas,0,27
110,good work  strive for more depth,0,6
118,prototype specific insights from the interview werent applied too much seems more like a general catchall motivation machine ajays case seems to revolve a lot around scores and exams how might we redesign the experience to maintain motivation for him when that happens,0,43
1630,clean slides and poster solid walkthrough good stuff make jj get some sleep,0,13
484,what new dimension will you bring to the table of  ever popular tourist app try discussing with a more specific user group  for instance for those who dont travel why is that the case,0,34
1635,impressive work guys congratulations on winning most elegant solution,0,9
568,great job only thing was that some of the violations could be further elaborated on in your bullet points as to why they are usability issues good comparative analyses,0,29
566,great job only thing was there wasnt enough comparative analysis between the two prototypes and a couple of the nonheuristic issues were missing severity ratings,1,25
567,great work only thing would be to add a specific severity rating for each violation rather than for the entire heuristic as a whole,0,24
1188,when you have time can tidy up some interface styling now,1,11
1189,functionality a lot of things are still pretty mocked together friends groups voting editingadding items to vote on influence use count etc profile and settings are bugged,0,27
1186,notes  definitely consider what you users will try to do if they want to reroll after the whole restrictions thing,0,20
1187,still not really clear how the friends group will be utilized,0,11
1184,functionality nice that the favorites are working now one bug though you get logged out when you try to search  probably not intended behavior,0,24
1185,dev plan awesome job taking things a step further and implementing some database things,0,14
1182,random notes  on signup i tried clicking the entire interest tag instead of just the checkbox to select it,0,19
1183,when you have time can work on some styling to enhance the interface for things like matching the club pages all that jazz,0,23
1180,nice animations,0,2
725,he should focus on general usability and functionality rather than on the detailed features of the prototype also should include a comparative analysis of the 2 prototypes as opposed to just listing the violations of each prototype,1,37
723,homepage url ensure youre completing the assignment,0,7
720,ensure youre completing entire assignment eg severity ratings  an easy way to do this is to look over the rubirc before you submit your assignment to ensure youve completed all aspects also a login page is not a home page,0,40
721,love that you added a screenshot of a particular suggested interface well done,0,13
1740,revisit a lot of these do not fit into how are you different from  why would people use your application instead of  in what situations would people use  instead of your application,0,32
729,some of the violations you mention were not wellcategorized into the given heuristic there was no indication what the different colors meant so i was unsure as to what they signified also no severity ratings given nice homepage link,0,39
1165,fantastic job with the app looking pretty much complete in functionality to me everything else is also well in place  dev plan links etc,0,24
1166,one thing that i would definitely change is indicating somehow that the buttons that arent clickable in the menu arent i remember observing people trying to click it in studio,0,30
1167,here are some considerations for some other possible changes  live update but youre already working on that p,0,18
1160,notes  i like how youve set up the two users to expedite the testing process,0,15
1161, i would look into httpsdevelopermozillaorgenusdocsmozillamobileviewportmetatag to make things look a bit more fitting on an actual mobile phone,0,18
1162,a lot of functionality progress since the last time nice,0,10
1163,one piece of functionality missing right now is creating a new user,0,12
1168, option for poll leader to vote i can see sometimes people who create the roompolls wanting to be able to vote themselves,0,22
48,interview questions could have been more general,0,7
49,overall good could have looking for 2 questions not a question and a comment was looking for a more fleshed out prototype,0,22
45,would be interesting to see how discovery via emotion plays a role in the future,0,15
43,missing in class worksheet,1,4
1568,poster was a bit too texty remember that for posters you want to focus more on the app and its functionalitydesign process rather than trying to explain everything through words,0,30
1298,deductions  achievements page lacks functionality,0,5
1299, it looks like the brunt of the work is on andres shoulders i dont see a single commit from grant is he pair programming with someone,0,26
1292,update thanks for submitting a working link reroll function still not functional but otherwise pretty complete,0,16
1293,the app as it is is not yet ready for testing as the quiz play mechanics are not fully functional i noticed on the dev plan that there is a pretty unequal distribution of work which may be the reason you are behind tasks should be evenly divided so as not to overwhelm any person especially since you are a group of 2 if youre having group problems please come see me,0,72
1290,dev plan i understand it was a struggle with the api business,0,12
1291,prototype link didnt work cannot give points for app functionality please send an updated working link to app for points to be awarded,0,23
1296, the analytics page doesnt provide any sort of concrete information about the total amount of time spent doing each task the pie chart should tell me how long spent in each category and also total time spent timing goals in a day,0,42
1297,another note  i noticed in your commit log that shuyu has not made any commits i did not subtract the point for evenly distributed work but is there a reason for this  please explain briefly  in your assignment 8 submission,0,40
1294, i shouldnt be able to edit a task that is currently being timed edit button should be greyed out in that case,0,22
1295, i dont see the option to set goals in the future it seems like this is a timer simply for the immediate time,0,23
1713,nicely done especially the video,0,5
474,not a point of view an example of a point of viewthis is just an example might be there are times when we feel inadequate or as if were not living our life to its fullest by reminding us of the highlights of our lives both the sad and happy we can reexperience those moments and learn more about ourselves becoming better individuals,0,63
1712,great work with revisiting inspirations,0,5
475,your storyboards were both hard to follow also the prototype isnt really apparent from reading them,0,16
1710,video can explain the apps motivation better how does this make cooking easier,0,13
1715,you want to make sure to really be convincing as to why your app is better than the ones you have listed other than that thanks for submitting this ec assignment,0,31
1201,reviews would be a perfect place to use each  since you guys are loading reviews from a database what happens when there are more than 4 reviews,0,27
1714,great video love it smooth transitions from taken photos into the application,0,12
1366,ab pages should not be separate apps they should all be in one app but different routes as in lab 7,0,21
473,inspirations lack competitive analysis  what other resources are currently available to address this user need eg quick google search brought me here httpwwwrescueorgusprogramussandiegoca what can you learn for their efforts,0,30
1364,testing the noise level of the environment is super cool you can make it more intuitive and get rid of the instructions by displaying a testing  countdown of seconds until it finishes the test which would give you a cleaner look as well new tutorial looks greatsame modal box screen size when looking through tutorial would be a good minor fix,0,61
1365,ab feedback to use for a9 make sure the features you are testing are quantifiable changing the color will not suffice as an ab test testing rate of added environments or rate of clicks to test sound because of the implementation of a tutorial or change of the test sound layout would provide meaningful data in the writeup you fail to specify quantifiable data or specific trackable changes that can be analyzed with statistical tests,0,75
1362,keep it up these final two weeks,0,7
1363,fyisound test does not work if i do not explicitly add https in front of app url,0,17
