Maybe once that is hidden, the box with the slides could become bigger? Because right now, it is pretty tiny and considering the amount of text on some professor's slides, it would be really difficult to read the slide due to the size.

1376,"The video link is broken, so I am basing this on your written description. The content of your idea is very practical. My friends and I regularly use sites like Slick Deals in order to find the best value. I realy appreciate an app alerting me on new deals. T-Mobile does this on Tuesdays through their app and I have been jumping on those deals, so I know this works! I also really like the fact that the app is smart enough to purchase items for you. Sometimes items run out of stock and it would be great if the app would buy it for you before it runs out. I would like to see if maybe the app can ask you if you would like to buy the item though. Or if the app can check your bank account to see if you have enough money. It would be horrible to get an overdraft fee due to this app!",160,1.0,1.0,1.0

1377,"Inch: Conceptually I think this is an interesting idea, however I do not think that an inch scale device is ideal for viewing images of anything. If you are on the bus, why not use your phone or a tablet that provides a larger scale? Foot: For the foot scale, I think that the use case is much more proper. However, your use case states that the user wants to check something out in Greece. Why give all the options for places around the globe or additional places that the user doesn't want, like Jordan? Maybe provide an interface before this screen that allows the user to select where they want, it animates in on the map and doesn't show other places. Yard: Seems to me like you mostly reused the foot interface for the yard. Watching videos/viewing content on a yard scale is obviously ideal but I think you can come up with more intuitive interactions than using a game controller.",162,1.0,1.0,1.0

1382,"Inch: I like the idea of being able to see how well you've slept using the watch interface but I do not think setting alarms for sleeping through the watch is a good interface, it would be easier to simply have the alarms sync from the phone. I like that you can see what you planned for breakfast to help the user stick to their planned (healthier?) choices but I don't think you need a yes or no for breakfast unless this is meant for tracking? In which case you would want the user to be able to say what they ended up having if it is different, maybe through speaking into the watch? This may just be me but in terms of drinking water your body should know when you are thirsty. If the point is to track what the user has had to drink that is a different story. It is also the same with snacks, I think it is a bit strange to have a designated snack time since it is healthier to eat the snack when hungry. (I may be misunderstanding this.",186,1.0,1.0,1.0
